 - Classification is the organisation of living organisms into groups

### The Concept of a Species
- A species is categorised as a group of organisms that are able to reproduce to produce living, fertile offspring.

### Naming Species - the Binomial System
- Developed by Linnaeus over 200 years ago, the binomial system which consists of 2 names:
    - Generic name - denotes the genus that the organism belongs to
    - Specific name - denotes the species that the organism belongs to (specific to the organism within the genus).
- It is universal and is based on either Latin or Greek names
- There are a number of rules that are applied to the use of binomial classification in academic writing
    - Names are italicized
    - The first letter of the generic name is capitalized while the specific name is undercase (Bufo bufo)
    - If specific names are not known it can be written as sp. (Bufo sp.)
- The naming of organisms is constantly changing as our understanding of them evolves
