### Hardy-Weinberg principal
- Discovered by GH Hardy and W Weinberg (1908)
    ''Heterozygotes are reservoirs of genetic variation''

- If we look at a particular characteristic in a population, it seems the dominant form expresses itself more than the recessive one. It might be thought that in time the dominant form would predominate to the point where the recessive type disappeared from the population completely.
- However, the Hardy-Weinberg principal suggests that the proportion of dominant and recessive alleles of a particular gene stays the same, it is not altered by interbreeding.
- This mathematical law depends on 4 conditions being met
    - No mutations arise
    - The population is isolated so there is no flow of genes into or out of the population
    - There is no natural selection
    - The population is large so mating is random

### Population:
- Is an interbreeding group of organisms capable of interbreeding with any other to produce fertile offspring.
- The genes of any individual organism are capable of being combined with the gene of any other.

### Gene pool
- The total of all genes in a population.

### Allele frequency
- The number of times any one allele occurs.

## Equations
### Allele frequency
- p + q = 1.0
    - p = frequency of the dominant allele
    - q = frequency of the recessive allele
    - 1 = gene pool

### Hardy-Weinberg
- p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
    - p^2 = Frequency of homozygous  dominant individuals
    - 2pq = Frequency of heterozygous individuals
    - q^2 = Frequency of homozygous recessive individuals
    - 1 = Total population

#### Examples
- Human suffering from insulin- dependant diabetes mellitas cannot secrete the hormone insulin. This disorder is inherited as a recessive allele at a single gene locus. If the frequency of this allele in a human population is 0.07, calculate the frequency of:
    - The normal allele | p = 1.0 - 0.07 = 0.93
    - People who suffer diabetes | q^2 = 0.07^2 = 0.0049
    - Heterozygote carriers of the diabetes allele | 2 x 0.93 x 0.07 = 0.13

- A population of Drosphilia contains 64 long winged flies and 36 vestigial winged flies
    - What is the frequency of the vestigial flies in this population | p^2 = 0.36
    - What is the frequency of the vestigial wings allele | 0.6
    - What is the frequency of the long winged allele | 0.8
    - What is the frequency of heterozygous flies | 2.2
