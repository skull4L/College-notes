- Variation in phenotype is due to both genetic and environmental factors
    - Often a combination of both
- The primary source of genetic variation is mutation
    - This variation is exacerbated by random fertilisation and meiosis 

### Genetic factors
- Different alleles of the same gene cause variations in phenotype
    - These can change over time
- This variation arises as a result of multiple factors
    - Mutations | A main source
    - Meiosis
    - Random fertilisation
- Sexually reproducing organisms utilise all 3 of these factors
- Genetic variation puts organisms into a few distinct forms.

### Environmental factors
