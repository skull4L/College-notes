- Monohybrid inheritance is the the inheritance of one characteristic
    - Mendel studied this by crossing a pure breeding green pod with a pure breeding yellow pod. All the offspring in the F generation were all green pods. This showed that green pod alleles were dominant
        - Pure breeding: Homozygous dominant or recessive.

### Green X Yellow
F1 generation:
Parental phenotypes: Green pods x Yellow pods
Parental genotypes: GG x gg

|     | G   | G   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| g   | Gg  | Gg  |
| g   | Gg  | Gg  |

### Green X Green
F2 generation
Parental phenotypes: Green pods x Green pods
Parental genotypes: Gg x Gg

|     | G   | g   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G   | GG  | Gg  |
| g   | Gg  | gg  |

### Conclusions
- Mendel concluded that in a monohybrid cross with heterozygous x heterozygous will give a 3:1 ratio

### Another Example
- Another example of this is when Mendel crossewd pure-breeding tall pea plants with pure breeding dwarf plants. All the offspring in the F1 generation were tall.
Parental phenotype: Tall x Dwarf
Parental genotypes: TT x tt

|     | T   | T   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| t   | Tt  | Tt  |
| t   | Tt  | Tt  |

- Mendel then crossed 2 of the F1 generation organisms to produce F2
Parental phenotype: Tall x Tall
Parental genotypes: Tt x Tt

|     | T   | t   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T   | TT  | Tt  |
| t   | Tt  | tt  |

- 3:1 ratio
