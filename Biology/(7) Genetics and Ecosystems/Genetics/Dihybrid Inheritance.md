- Inheritance of 2 characteristics, determined by 2 different genes located on different chromosomes
- Mendel investigated inheritance further by observing 2 characteristics of the pea plants.
    - He observed
        - Seed shape: Round is dominant to wrinkled
        - Seed colour: Yellow coloured is dominant to green
            R = Allele for round seed
            r = Allele for wrinkled seeds
            G = Allele for yellow seeds
            g = Allele for green seeds

### F1
Parental phenotypes: Round, yellow seeds x wrinkled green seeds
Parental genotypes: RRGG x rrgg

|     | RG   | RG   |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| rg  | RgGg | RgGg |
| rg  | RgGg | RgGg |

Offspring genotypes in F1 generation: All RrGg
Offspring phenotypes in F1 generation : All round, yellow

### F2
- Mendel then crossed 2 of F1 generation
Parental phenotypes: Round, yellow seeds x Round, yellow seeds
Parental genotypes: RgGg x RgGg

|     | RG   | Rg   | rG   | rg   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| RG  | RRGG | RRGg | RrGG | RrGg |
| Rg  | RRGg | RRgg | RrGg | Rrgg |
| rG  | RrGG | RrGg | rrGG | rrGg |
| rg  | RrGg | Rrgg | rrGg | rrgg |

Offspring phenotypes in F2 generation : 9 Round Yellow, 3 Round Green, 3 Wrinkled Yellow, 1 Wrinkled Green

- Mendel concluded that a dihybrid cross of 2 characteristics heterozygous would give a 9:3:3:1 ratio. He related this to the law of independent assortment and stated that each member of a pair of alleles can randomly combine with another pair.

### Another Example of Dihybrid Inheritance

### F1
- A dihybrid cross was carried out between fruit flies with red eyes and vestigial wings and pink eyes and normal wings.
    R = red eyes
    r = pink eyes
    N = normal wings
    n = vestigial wings

Parental phenotypes: Red eyes and vestigial wings x Pink eyes and normal wings
Parental genotypes: RRnn x rrNN
Gametes: Rn Rn x rN rN

|     | Rn   | Rn   |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| rN  | RrNn | RrNn |
| rN  | RrNn | RrNn |

Offspring genotypes in F1 generation: All RrNn
Offspring phenotypes in F1 generation : Red eyes and normal wings

### F2
Parental phenotypes: Red eyes normal wings x Red eyes normal wings
Parental genotypes: RrNn x RrNn
Gametes: RN Rn rN rn x RN Rn rN rn

|     | RN   | Rn   | rN   | rn   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| RN  | RRNN | RRNn | RrNN | RrNn |
| Rn  | RRNn | RRnn | RrNn | Rrnn |
| rN  | RrNN | RrNn | rrNN | rrNn |
| rn  | RrNn | Rrnn | rrNn | rrnn |

Offspring phenotypes: 9 Red eyes Normal wings, 3 Red eyes Vestigial wings, 3 Pink eyes Normal wings, 1 Pink eyes Vestigial wings
