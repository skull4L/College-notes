### Locus
- The location of a gene in a chromosome
### Phenotype
- Observable characteristics of an organism
### Genotype
- The combination of all the alleles possessed by an organism
### Dominant
- Characteristic in which the allele responsible is expressed in the phenotype, even in those with heterozygous genotypes
### Codominant
- Both alleles contribute to the phenotype
### Recessive
- Allele that is only expressed when a dominant gene is not present.
### Heterozygous
