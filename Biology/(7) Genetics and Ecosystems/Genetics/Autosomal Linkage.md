- All chromosomes except the ones that determine sex
- 2 or more genes can be carried on the same chromosome
- In humans, 23 pairs of chromosomes carry genes that determine characteristics, each chromosome must possess many different genes
- Any 2 genes on the same chromosome are linked
- 22 chromosomes are called autosomes
- If genes A and B occur on seperate chromosomes they are not linked.

- If genes A and B are linked the linked genes remain together during meiosis and pass into the gametes.
