- Mendel predicted specific ratios

| Ratio   | Description                                                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3:1     | Monohybrid crosses of 2 heterozygotes (Tt x Tt)                               |
| 9:3:3:1 | Dihybrid cross of organisms heterozygous for both features (YyRr x YyRr)      |
| 1:2:1   | Monohybrid cross of 2 heterozygotes with codominance (RW x RW)                |
| 1:1     | Monohybrid cross of homozygous recessive with a heterozygote (tt x Tt)        |
| 1:1:1   | Dihybrid cross of a doubke recessive with a double heterozygote (ggnn x GgNn) |

- In reality these predicted ratios are rarely achieved because:
    - Random fertilisation does not occur
    - Population is small
- A Chi squared test is used to see if there is a significant difference between the observed and expected results, in categorical data.

### Example 1
- 2 pea plants heterozygous for purple flowers were crossed. We would expect a 3:1 ratio in the F1 generation. The observed results are 81 purple and 19 white. Is there a significant difference in the observed and expected results?
- Null hypothesis
    - There is no significant difference between the observed and expected results in the purple and white flowers. The results have occurred due to chance.

| Feature        | Observed | Expected     | O.E | O.E^2 | (O.E^2)/E  |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------ | --- | ----- | ---------- |
| Purple flowers | 81       | (3/4)x100=75 | -6  | 36    | 36/75=0.48 |
| White flowers  | 19       | (1/4)x100=25 | -6  | 36    | 36/25=1.44 |
| Total          | 100      | 3:1 ratio    |     |       |            |
