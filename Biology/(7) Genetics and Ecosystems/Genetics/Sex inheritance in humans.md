- Females are homogametic (XX)
-  Males are heterogametic (XY)

### inheritance of sex alleles
Parental phenotypes: male x female
Parental genotypes XY x XX
Gametes: X Y x X X

|     | X   | Y   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X   | XX  | XY  |
| X   | XX  | XY  | 

### Sex linkage
- Any gene that is carried on either the X or Y chromosome is sex linked. The X chromosome is much longer than the Y chromosome.
- Males are much more likely to be the sufferers of sex linked diseases. This is because the Y chromosome is does not have alleles so they only need 1 copy of it to express the disease.

### Haemophilia
- Caused by a recessive allele and is sex linked due to the lack of blood clotting factor 8 so the blood takes a lot longer to clot
