- One gene has more than 2 alleles
    - Eg: Human ABO blood group
        - There are 3 alleles associated with the Immunoglobin gene which is called I

| Blood group | Possible genotypes |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| A           | Ia Ia or Ia Io     |
| B           | Ib Ib or Ib Io     |
| AB          | Ia Ib              |
| O           | Io Io              |

Parental phenotypes: blood group A x blood group B
Parental genotypes: Ia Io x Ib Io

|     | Ia   | Io   |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| Ib  | IaIb | IbIo |
| Io  | IaIo | IoIo |
