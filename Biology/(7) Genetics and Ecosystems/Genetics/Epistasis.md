- The interaction of different gene loci where 1 gene locus suppresses the expression of another gene locus
- One gene will suppress the expression of another

## Recessive Epistasis
- Inheritance of flower colour in Salvia
    - 2 gene loci
        - A/a
        - B/b
    - A pure breeding pink flowered variety of salvia with the genotype AAbb was crossed with a pure breeding white variety with genotype aaBB.
        - All offspring in F1 were AaBb

### F1
Parental phenotypes: Pink flowered x White flowered
genotypes: AAbb x aaBB
gametes: Ab Ab x aB aB

|     | Ab   | Ab   |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| aB  | AaBb | AaBb |
| aB  | AaBb | AaBb |

All offspring genotypes: AaBb
All offsping phenotypes: purple

### F2
- 2 F1 were crossed
    - B = purple
    - b = pink
- homozygous aa is epistatic to both B and b
- B for purple and b for pink cannot be expressed if there is no dominant A

Parental phenotypes: Purple x Purple
genotypes: AaBb x AaBb
gametes: AB Ab aB ab x AB Ab aB ab

|     | AB   | Ab   | aB   | ab   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| AB  | AABB | AABb | AaBB | AaBb |
| Ab  | AABb | AAbb | AaBb | Aabb |
| aB  | AaBB | AaBb | aaBB | aaBb |
| ab  | AaBb | Aabb | aaBb | aabb |

All offsping phenotypes: (9)Purple (4)White (3)Pink

## Dominant Epistasis
- Occurs when a dominant allele at one gene locus masks the effect of the alleles at the second gene locus

### F1
- Example: inheritance of feather colour in chickens
    - There is an interaction between 2 gene loci
        - I/i
        - C/c
    - Individuals with I have white feathers, even if they also carry the dominant C for coloured feathers.
    - Birds that are homozygous for c are white
    - pure breeding white leghorn (IICC) x Pure breeding white wycindotte (iicc)
        - All offspring were white IiCc

### F2
White feathered (IiCc) x White feathered (IiCc)
gametes: IC Ic iC ic x IC Ic iC ic

|     | IC   | Ic   | iC   | ic   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| IC  | IICC | IICc | IiCC | IiCc |
| Ic  | IICc | IIcc | IiCc | Iicc |
| iC  | IiCC | IiCc | iiCC | iiCc |
| ic  | IiCc | Iicc | iiCc | iicc |

Coloured:
    iiCc
    iiCC
