- Mendelian genetics predicts specific ratios from certain types of crosses:

### Ratios
3:1 = Monohybrid cross of 2 heterozygotes
9:3:3:1 = Dihybrid cross heterozygous of 2 characteristics
1:2:1 = Monohybrid cross of 2 heterozygotes with codominance
1:1:1:1 = Dihybrid cross of double recessive with a double heterozygotes

- In reality these predicted ratios are rarely achieved. These ratios assume that there will be completely random fertilization and a large population. These conditions are rarely met, laws of chance have a greater impact.
