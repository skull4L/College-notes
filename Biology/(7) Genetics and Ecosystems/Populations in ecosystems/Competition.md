## Intraspecific Competition
- Occurs when individuals of the same species compete with each other for resources such as food, water and breeding sites
- It's the availability of these resources that determines the size of the population and the degree of competition between individuals which can result in a smaller population.

###### Examples
- limpets competing for algae; more algae means more limpets
- oak trees competing for resources; more trees leads to die offs, smaller population of larger trees remain
- robins competing for breeding territory; females mate with individuals with territory, less food means less territory space, meaning less breeding pairs, so smaller population

## Interspecific Competition
- Individuals of different species compete for resources like food, light and water.
- When populations of 2 species are in competition one will normally have a competative advantage over the other
- The population of this species will gradually increase in size while the population of the other will diminish
- If these conditions stay the same, this will lead to the complete removal of one species. This is called the competitive exclusion principle.

###### Competitive Exclusion Principle
- This states that no 2 species can occupy the same [[Populations and ecosystems#Ecological niche|niche]] indefinitely
- The species that can use the limited resources more efficiently will ultimately eliminate the other
