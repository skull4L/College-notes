## Intraspecific competition
- Occurs when individuals of the same species compete with each other for resources such as food, water and breeding sites
- It's the availability of these resources that determines the size of the population and the degree of competition between individuals which can result in a smaller population.

## Interspecific competition
- Individuals of different species compete for resources like food, light and water.
- When populations of 2 species are in competition one will normally have a competative advantage over the other
- The population of this species will gradually increase in size while the population of the other will diminish
- If these conditions stay the same, this will lead to the complete removal of one species. This is called the competitive exclusion principle.
