- Chromosomes do not separate into 2 distinct sets during meiosis. This means the gametes are diploid and not haploid
    - If these fused with one another the offspring would have 4 sets of chromosomes (tetraploid)
    - If a diploid gamete fused with a haploid gamete, the offspring would have 3 sets of chromosomes (triploid)
- Hybrids are usually sterile but if the hybrid has a chromosome number that is multiple of the original chromosome, new fertile species can occur because the chromosomes have homolougous pertners to pair up with in meiosis 1
