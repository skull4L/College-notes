- Succession describes the changes that occur over time in an ecosystem. Abiotic factors change because of the species present

## Primary Succession
- Happens on an area of land that has never been colonized before, such as new volcanic islands or newly exposed land caused by sea level drop

## Secondary Succession
- Happens on land that has already been colonized by the pioneer species, the plants may be cleared but soil stays intact. Examples of this include, forest fires, deforestation, grazing or disease.

## Common Features of Succession
- The abiotic environment becomes less hostile so species composition increases as they change the habitat, so other species can colonize and become better competitors
    - A greater number and variety of habitats are produced
    - More food sources
    - Increased biodiversity
    - More complex food webs
    - Increased biomass

###### Pioneer Species
- First species to colonize a bare ground or rock
- Have specialized adaptations which make them suitable for this:
    - Asexual reproduction
    - Produce large quantities of seeds or spores
    - Rapid germination
    - Ability to fix nitrogen from the [[Nitrogen cycle#Nitrogen fixation|atmosphere]]
    - Tolerant to extreme conditions

## Succession of a Woodland
- Each stage in succession is called a **sere**

###### Barren Land
- Could be due to new rock deposits caused by a volcanic eruption or newly exposed bare rock

###### Pioneer species/primary Colonizers
- First species to colonize the area such as lichens which can survive the hostile conditions of bare rock
- Over time the bare rock is eroded to produce sand/soil
- Eventually lichens die off and decompose adding nutrients to the soil allowing the growth of other plants

###### Secondary Colonizers
- Mosses begin to grow and the rocks continue to erode, which helps to build up soil.
- Death of mosses release more organic matter.
- This helps to hold onto moisture, allowing more plants to grow
- Moss growth provides growth for organisms

###### Tertiary Colonizers
- Grasses and small flowering plants begin to grow. Shrubs and small trees then grow
- These species provide more food sources, leading to more food chains which form more complex food webs

###### Climax Community
- This is the final community
- No further succession takes place.
- Increased biodiversity

###### Summary
- Colonization by pioneer species
- Pioneer species change the environment (forms soil)
- Environment becomes more suitable for other species so they can survive
- Increase in biodiversity so more variety of habitats, different variety of food sources
- biomass increases
- Climax community is reached
