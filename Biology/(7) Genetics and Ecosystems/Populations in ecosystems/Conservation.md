- Conservation is the management of the Earth's natural resources by humans E.g. maintaining biodiversity, including diversity between different species, genetic diversity within the same species and maintain variety of habitats and ecosystems.

## Main reasons for conservation
###### Personal
- maintain our planet
###### Ethical
- respect for living organisms/plants that have occupied the Earth longer than we have
###### Economic
- Living organisms have huge genetic diversity with valuable uses in future e.g. medicine, food sources, natural predators of pests which can act as a biological control, drought tolerance in wheat or improved crop yield.
###### Cultural and aesthetic
- Habitats and organisms enrich our lives. Ecotourism and recreation in the countryside have social and financial values.

## Conservation methods
###### Conserving habitats by managing sucession
- Conservation involves preventing sucession to preserve an ecosystem in its current stage of sucession. For example
    - Animals are allowed to graze on the land
    - Managed fires are lit
    - Mowing of the grass

###### Seed banks
- Store of seeds from lots of different plant species
- If plant species becomes extinct or lost from a particular habitat, stored seeds can be used to reintroduce the species
- Large number of seeds can be stored, anywhere in the world and for long periods of time
- But does require regular testing to see if they can still grow to become a plant, this can be expensive and time consuming

###### Captive breeding
- Breeding animals in controlled environments
- Endangered species or those extinct in the wild can be bred in captivity to increase their numbers
- However animals (e.g. pandas) can have problems breeding outside their natural habitat
- Reintroducing animals could cause disease to habitats, harming other species living

###### Fishing quotas
- Limit amount of certain fish that fisherman are allowed to catch
- Help to conserve fish species by reducing the numbers that are caught and killed
- Try to avoid extinction of certain fish species
- However limit potential income for fishermen
- Discards, catching more fish then they are allowed to then throwing back some fish which are often dead so they don't go beyond their quota

###### Protected areas
- e.g. National parks and nature reserves, protect habitats and the species in them by restricting urban development, industrial development and farming
- Habitats in protected areas can be managed to conserve them
- National parks are used as tourist destinations (which are funded)
- Often a conflict between the need to conserve habitats and the need to allow people to visit and use them
