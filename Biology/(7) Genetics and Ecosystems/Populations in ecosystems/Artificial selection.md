- Artificial selection is the deliberate breeding of organisms to select for desirable qualities such as crop yield, animal behaviour or meat production

###### Example: Dairy cow
- Humans have selected animals for docility, meat and milk production and ability to survive in specific climates
- This has led to the creation of many breeds of dairy cows such as Holstein-Friesian, Brown Swiss, Guernsey, Ayrshire, Jersey and Milky Shorthorn
- By repeatedly selecting cows with high milk yields and allowing them to breed over many generations, humans have artificially selected improved breeds

###### Example: Bread wheat
- Modern wheat, Triticum aestivum, has evolved by selection beginning with a cross hybridisation of wild einkorn with a wild goat grass (AB). The hybrid cannot produce gametes. (One A from einkorn and one B from goat grass)
- The hybrid will then undergo [[Polyploidy]] which doubles the diploid nucleus.
- This produced emmer wheat, a species of AABB which is able to produce gametes. 
- It then reproduces with another unknown species of grass to produce another infertile hybrid of 3n ABC
- A random polyploidy occurs again producing a 6n hybrid of ABBCC.
- This is modern wheat
- The characteristics of this wheat are still being modified via artificial selection by humans
