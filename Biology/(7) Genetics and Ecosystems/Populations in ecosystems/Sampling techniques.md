- Generate your random number co-ordinates using a random number generator
- Place the 4 mÂ² quadrat at the co-ordinate
- Record the number of different species present
- Repeat for 10 quadrats
- Calculate the % frequency

>% Frequency = Total Frequency / Total number of quadrats X 100

## Mark and release and recapture
