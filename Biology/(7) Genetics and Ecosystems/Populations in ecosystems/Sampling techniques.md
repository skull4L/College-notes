## Quadrat sampling
- Lay out four tape measures to from a 10m by 10m square area in the area to be sampled.
- Generate your random number co-ordinates using a random number generator
- Place the 4 mÂ² quadrat at the co-ordinate
- Record the number of different species present
- Repeat for 10 quadrats
- Calculate the % frequency

>% Frequency = Total Frequency / Total number of quadrats X 100

## Mark and release and recapture
- Catch a sample of the population
- Mark them in a suitable way e.g. with non toxic paint
- Record the number marked
- Release the animals & let them mix back into the population
- After a suitable time interval catch another sample
- Record the total number caught this time & the number of marked animals recaptured

> Estimated population size = (total number of individuals in the first sample x total number of individuals in the second sample) / number of marked individuals recaptured

## Belt transect
- Quadrats are placed alongside the tape
###### Continuous belt transect
- Record along the whole length of the tape
###### Interrupted belt transect
- Record at intervals along the tape e.g. 2m, 4m, 6m etc
###### Method
- Place transect using a measuring tape (10m) along the area of change 2) Use a 1m x 1m frame quadrat at regular intervals (every 2m)
- Record the number of species present
- Repeat this for the next interval until you each the end of the transect
