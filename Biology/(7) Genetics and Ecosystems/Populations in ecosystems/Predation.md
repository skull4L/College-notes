- Occurs when one organism consumes another
- In nature populations of predators and pray stay at a relatively stable level
- This is due to the diversity of natural environments, meaning prey species are much more likely to escape potential predators
- Therefore in nature, prey species usually don't go extinct
- In a laboratory it is very difficult to gather data on predation, this is because often the environments of a laboratory do not offer prey species the same opportunities for survival meaning that they often become extinct
- It can also be difficult to gather data in a natural setting, this is because it is impossible to count all individuals in a wild population. Therefore, populations can only be estimated via sampling surveys

## Effect of Predator-prey Relationship on Population Size
- Predators eat prey, thereby reducing the population of prey.
- With fewer prey available, the predators are in greater competition with each other for the prey that are left.
- The predator population is reduced as some individuals are unable to obtain enough prey for their survival or to reproduce.
- With fewer predators left, fewer prey are eaten and so more survive and are able to reproduce.
- The prey population therefore increases.
- With more prey now available as food, the predator population in turn increases.
