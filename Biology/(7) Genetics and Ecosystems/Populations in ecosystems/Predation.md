- Occurs when one organism consumes another
- In nature populations of predators and pray stay at a relatively stable level
- This is due to the diversity of natural environments, meaning prey species are much more likely to escape potential predators
- Therefore in nature, prey species usually don't go extinct
- In a laboratory it is very difficult to gather data on predation, this is because often the environments of a laboratory do not offer prey species the same opportunities for survival meaning that they often become extinct
- It can also be difficult to gather data in a natural setting, this is because it is impossible to count all individuals in a wild population. Therefore, populations can only be estimated via sampling surveys
