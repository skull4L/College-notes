- Ecology is the study of the interrelationships between organisms and their environment. This includes abiotic and biotic factors
### Ecosystems
- Ecosystems are systems made up of both biotic and abiotic factors. Within an ecosystem there are 2 major processes
    - Flow of energy through the system
    - Cycling of elements through the system
- There is little to no transfer of nutrients between ecosystems. It can be said that ecosystems have a fixed nutrient budget
- In an ecosystem there is a number of populations of different species

### Populations
- A population is a group of individuals of a species that exist in a particular environment
- The maximum size of population an ecosystem can support is called the carrying capacity
- The size of a population can vary as a result of:
    - Abiotic factors
    - Interaction between organisms such as intraspecific and interspecific competition and predation
- Populations of different species form a community test

### Community
- A community is a collection of populations of species that live and interact with each other.

### Habitat
- The place where an organism can be naturally found
