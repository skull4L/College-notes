- Selection pressures determine the frequency of alleles within a gene pool
    - This is the driving force behind natural selection
- Evolution via natural selection depends on the following factors
    - Organisms produce more offspring than can be supported by the environment (meaning not all will survive)
    - There is genetic variety within the population
    - A variety of phenotypes that selection operates against

### Over-production of offspring
- Death rate in natural populations is high
    - High reproduction rate compensates for this to make sure a sufficiently large population survives to breed
    - High death rate is as a result of predation, food/water availability, extreme temperatures, natural disasters such as fire, disease and earthquakes
- over-population results in intraspecific competition (competition within a species) for limited resources
    - The greater the population the greater the competition
        - This means more organisms will die
- Those most suited to the conditions are more likely to survive, those less suited end up dying
    - These individuals are more likely to breed and therefore pass their genetics
        - This causes the combination of alleles in the population to slowly shift

### Variation
- Due to random fertilisation and meiosis offspring are genetically different to their parents
    - As conditions change, different combinations of alleles may become favourable for survival
        - This means that at least some of the population will have the correct combination to survive most changes in environment
- Populations with less genetic variation are often more vulnerable to environmental changes
- Larger populations have a greater degree of genetic variation
    - This means that there is a greater chance that some individuals will posses the best combination of alleles that allow for survival
        - This means that larger populations are much more adaptable to change

- This effect of variation was noticed by Darwin who wrote:
    - "How can it be doubted, from the struggle each individual has to obtain subsistence, that any minute variation in structure, habits or instinct, adapting that individual better to the new conditions, would tell upon its vigour and health? In the struggle it would have a better chance of surviving, and those of its offspring which inherited the variation, be ever so slight, would have a better chance"
