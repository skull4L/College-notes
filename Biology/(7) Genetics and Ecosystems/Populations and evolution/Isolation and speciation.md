- In a population the alleles of any one individual can combine with those of any other to create a genetically unique individual
- All the alleles found in a population at any given time is known as a gene pool
- The frequency of the occurrence of an allele in a gene pool is known as allelic frequency (shocking right?)
- Evolution via natural selection is the change in the allelic frequencies within a population

### Speciation
- All species evolve from existing ones
- Members of a species are able to reproduce with each other and not others
- They are reproductively separated from other species

- New species form when 2 populations become reproductively separated in some way. This can be as a result of genetic change caused by natural selection.
- Members of the same species are capable of breeding with members from different populations.
- If 2 populations become separated for long enough, this may no longer be the case, as they for 2 separate gene pools and undergo different mutations. They will eventually become genetically different
- Each population will experience different selection pressures due to different climates further driving them apart.
- Allele frequencies will change between the 2 populations as they adapt to their different environments. This is known as adaptive radiation
- This means that eventually the 2 populations will be no longer able to interbreed. By this point they are 2 different species each with a separate gene pool

- In small populations, speciation can occur via genetic drift
- Small populations are less genetically diverse (smaller variety of alleles). The alleles that do get passed on will quickly affect the entire population as they quickly become more common.
- Any selectively favoured mutations will therefore quickly effect the entire population as there is a limited gene pool for other alleles.
- This causes rapid change in small populations, making it more likely for a new species to develop
- In larger populations the effect of a mutant allele will be quickly diluted as it is much less frequent within the gene pool

### Allopatric speciation
- This is where populations become geographically separated via either a physical barrier between 2 populations which stops them from interbreeding.
- Varying environmental conditions on either side of this barrier cause the 2 populations to be influenced by natural selection differently causing them to diverge into separate species

### Sympatric speciation
- This is where populations within the same area become reproductively separated
- An example of this separation can be seasons or niches. This means that individuals are less likely to come across each other and interbreed
