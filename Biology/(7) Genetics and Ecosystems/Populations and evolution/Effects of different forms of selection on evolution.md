- Environmental factors which create [[Natural Selection#Variation|variation]] in a population can act as an agent for constancy or an agent for change.
- Within a population there will be a range of genetically different phenotypes, this forms a normal distribution curve
- The main types of [[Natural Selection|selection]]:
    - Stabilising | favours the average phenotype
    - Directional | favours an extreme phenotype
    - Disruptive | favours 2 different extreme phenotypes, is the mechanism by which new species evolve.

### Stabilising Selection
- Eliminates extremes of the phenotype range
- Occurs when environmental conditions are static (they do not change)
- An example of this is body mass of human babies at birth
    - Babies with a body mass greater than or less than the mean of 3.2kg have a greater risk of premature death

### Directional Selection
- If environmental conditions change, so will the optimum phenotype for survival. This means that a more extreme phenotype on the distribution curve will be favoured instead of the mean.
- This causes the mean to shift to the most optimum phenotype, causing the distribution curve to move to the left or the right

### Disruptive Selection
- The least common form of selection
- Occurs when an environmental factor takes 2 distinct forms (such as when populations are geographically separated)
- This causes 2 extreme phenotypes to be favoured leading to speciation

### Selection in the Peppered Moth
- Some species have 2 or more distinct forms, this is known as polymorphism
- An example of this is the Peppered moth, which has a light and dark variety.
- This occurred due to pollution as a result of the industrial revolution which caused a melanistic variety to become more common. This was because they were able to blend in better with the darker environment caused by soot darkening which made them more likely to survive and reproduce
- The light form was better adapted to surviving in more rural, less polluted areas. This caused dark populations to exist in industrial areas and light populations to exist in rural areas
- The 2 varieties can still interbreed as they are still the same species, for them do become 2 different species they'd need to become reproductivly separated
