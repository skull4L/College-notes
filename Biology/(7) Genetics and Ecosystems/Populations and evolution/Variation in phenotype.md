- [[Natural Selection#Variation|Variation]] in phenotype is due to both genetic and environmental factors
    - Often a combination of both
- The primary source of genetic variation is mutation
    - This variation is exacerbated by random fertilisation and meiosis 

### Genetic factors
- Different alleles of the same gene cause variations in phenotype
    - These can change over time
- This variation arises as a result of multiple factors
    - Mutations | A main source
    - Meiosis
    - Random fertilisation
- Sexually reproducing organisms utilise all 3 of these factors
- Genetic variation puts organisms into a few distinct forms.

### Environmental factors
- The environment influences all organisms
    - This affects how genes are expressed
- Environmental influences include climatic conditions, soil conditions, pH, and food availability
- Some characteristics exist on a spectrum (for example height and mass)
    - These characteristics are controlled by many genes (polygenes)
- Environmental factors play a huge role on where in the spectrum the organism is found
- In most cases variation is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors
    - This makes it difficult to determine the causes of variation.

### Discontinuous variation
- Characteristics of the phenotype that are placed into definite categories, with no intermediates
    - Male or female
    - Attached or unattached earlobes
- Often controlled by a single gene

### Continuous variation
- Characteristics of the phenotype exist on a wide spectrum of variation with no distinct categories
    - Height
    - IQ
    - weight
