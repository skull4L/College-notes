- ?
- Generates its own electrical impulses
- Speeds up processes
- Detects changes in CO2 concentration
- Aeration, allows bacteria in soil to respire aerobically which helps speed up decomposition allowing nutrients to be recycled (conversion of ammonia ions into nitrites and then nitrates).
- Phosphorylation of glucose which makes it more reactive, active transport of pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix.

>7/11/22

- ? [Aorta, caratid artery, medulla]
- to detect changes in blood pressure
- IIA? [Rhoedopsin]
- They have an individual bipolar nerve each, so all connected to the optic nerve
- Red Green Blue (RGB)
- 3 variants with different versions of the pigment. [Different wavelengths can detected by more than one cone cell, overlap creates more colours]

>15/11/22

- the myosin and actin filaments sliding towards eachother [specify Z lines]
- A band
- I band [also H zone]
- Contraction of muscles [by releases calcium ions]
- [actin]

>21/11/22

- ? [cholinergic is neuron to neuron. neuromuscular is neuron to muscle]
- Conversion of ADP+Pi into ATP
- slow twitch have a longer endurance while fast twitch do not
- active transport of calcium ions, ?
- I band stays the same size, H zone stays the same
- ?

>22/11/22

- actin, mysocin
- calcium
- a neuron that connects to muscle fibres
- so the muscle can relax [stop action potentials]
- ?
- ?

>29/11/22

- Breaks hydrogen bonds
- due to a change in conditions the system deviates further from the norm.
- ?

>4/1/23

- Movement away or towards a stimulus
- More sensitive to light
- ?
- ?
- ?

> 9/1/23

- A different version of a gene
- 2 of the same alleles in a pair
- 2 different alleles in a pair
- Both alleles contribute to the phenotype
- ?
- The sum of all genes in an organism

>11/1/23

pathogens are detected by the phagocytes, they engulf them in a phagosome and use enzymes stored in lysosomes to break down the pathogen. The antigens of the pathogens are the presented on the cell membrane of the phagocyte. This is called antigen presentation. Helper T cells then are stimulated by these antigens and activate B cells and cytotoxic T cells. The B cell creates antibodies which are complimentary to the antigen. The B cells undergo clonal expansion and become plasma cells and memory cells. The plasma cells can then release these antibodies which clump to the antigens of the pathogen, disabling it.

>16/1/23

e = XRXr f = XRY

>31/1/23
    - No mutation
    - No addition or loss of genes
    - random mating
- The proportion of the population that expresses a particular allele
