- ?
- Generates its own electrical impulses
- Speeds up processes
- Detects changes in CO2 concentration
- Aeration, allows bacteria in soil to respire aerobically which helps speed up decomposition allowing nutrients to be recycled (conversion of ammonia ions into nitrites and then nitrates).
- Phosphorylation of glucose which makes it more reactive, active transport of pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix.

- They have an individual bipolar nerve each, so all connected to the optic nerve
- Red Green Blue (RGB)
- 3 variants with different versions of the pigment. [Different wavelengths can detected by more than one cone cell, overlap creates more colours]
