- The surface area to volume ratio influences how substances and heat energy can be transferred around multicellular organisms.
###### Surface area
- The surface area of an organism is the total surface over which substances can be exchanged
- Surface area alone cannot influence the rate of exchange
- The surface area of an organism relative to their volume is more important
###### Volume
- The volume of an organism determines the number of substances that need to be taken in and transported out
- As the volume increases, more materials are needed for metabolism because there are more cells
###### Surface area to volume ratio
- When an organism increases in size, its volume increases because there are more cells
- The increase in the number of cells means that there is less surface area for the exchange of materials because many cells are in contact with one another
    - The surface area to volume ratio (SA : V) decreases as an organism gets bigger

## Adaptations to surface area to body ratio
- Some organisms have evolved adaptations that allow them to overcome a decrease in surface area to volume ratio.
- These include:
###### Large surface area
- A large surface area allows more of a substance to diffuse at the same time
###### Thin membrane
- A thin membrane reduces the diffusion distance
###### Transport systems
- Some organisms have transport systems that move substances around the organism or facilitate exchange
    - Such as blood vessels, lungs, gills, xylem
- Transport systems allow a higher concentration gradient to be maintained
    - A steep concentration gradient increases the rate of transport 
- Transport systems also allow substances to move closer to the cells that need to exchange them
###### Heat transfer
- Some large animals have adaptations that allow heat to be transferred more efficiently
    - E,g, Elephants have large, highly vascularised ears that allow heat to be transferred rapidly
