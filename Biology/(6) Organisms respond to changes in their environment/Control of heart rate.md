>Question: Describe how heartbeat is initiated and coordinated (5)

- The heart is myogenic, the heart rate is controlled by the pacemaker cells in the heart found in the sinoatrial node (SAN). 
- The SAN sends out electrical impulses across the atria causing atrial contraction. 
- Non conducting tissue prevents immediate contraction of ventricles. AVN delays impulses whilst blood leaves atria. 
- AVN sends out an electrical impulse down the bundle of His which causes ventricles to contract from base up
