>Question: Describe how heartbeat is initiated and coordinated (5)

- The heart is myogenic, the heart rate is controlled by the pacemaker cells in the heart found in the sinoatrial node (SAN) found in the right atrium. 
- The SAN sends out electrical impulses across the atria causing atrial contraction. 
- Non conducting tissue prevents immediate contraction of ventricles. 
- AVN delays impulses whilst blood leaves atria. 
- AVN sends out an electrical impulse down the bundle of His which causes ventricles to contract from base up

The actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system are ==antagonistic.== 

This means that if one system contracts a muscle, then the other relaxes it. Activities of internal glands and muscles are regulated by a balance of the 2 systems

### Nervous system
Peripheral nervous system (PNS): Made up of nerves which originate from the brain or spinal cord.
    Sensory nervous system: Carries nerve impulses from receptors to CMS
    Motor nervous system: Carries nerve impulses away from the CMS to the effector. 

### The autonomic nervous system

The sympathetic nervous system:
    - stimulates effectors.
    - Speeds up the activity.
    - Controls effectors when we exercise strenuously, experience stress or fight or flight response. 

The parasympathetic nervous system:
    - Inhibits effectors
    - Slows down any activity
    - Controls activities under normal resting conditions
    - Conserves energy and replenishes the body's reserve.
