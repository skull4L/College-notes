- Skeletal muscles are ==antagonistic.== This means that they always occur in pairs that act against each other.
- They can only contract and relax, ==they cannot push.==

### The gross structure of the skeletal muscle
![[Pasted image 20221114094506.png]]

### Structure of actin and myosin molecules and their arrangement
- Each muscle fibre is made up of myofibrils. Myofibrils are made up of 2 protein filaments:
    - Actin which is thinner and consists of 2 strands twisted around each other
    - Mysosin which is thicker and consists of long rod shaped tails with bulbous heads that projects to the side

### Sarcomere structure

- When the sarcomere contacts:
    - I band becomes narrower
    - Z lines move closer together
    - H zone becomes narrower
    - A band stays the same width

- The decrease in length of the sarcomere is caused when the Z lines move closer together causing the actin filaments to slide between the myosin, the H zone becomes narrower

### Myofibril contraction
- Head of myosin bind to the actin and pulls the actin
- Myosin detaches from the actin and moves further along the actin
- This uses ATP

- The actin filament is formed from a helix of actin sub-units. Each contains a binding site for the myosin heads.
- Tropomyosin (shown in blue) is wound around the actin.
- It moves out of the way when calcium ions bind so allow the myosin to bind to the actin (cross bridge formation)

### Importance of ATP
- Cross-bridge formation between actin and myosin
- Power stroke movement
- Detachment of myosin heads
- Allow myosin heads to move back to original position (recovery stroke)

>Question: Explain why a person with mitochondrial disease can only excersise for a short time (2)

Mitochondrial disease limits the production of ATP which is required for muscle contraction. by limiting the aerobic respiration of mitochondria. Without this ATP cross bridge formation between actin and myosin does not take place,

### Energy supply during muscle contraction
- Energy for muscle contraction is supplied by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi
- In a very active muscle the demands for ATP and oxygen is greater than the rate at which the blood can supply oxygen. So there needs to be a way of rapidly generating ATP anaerobically. This is partly achieved by using a chemical called phosphocreatine and by using more glycolysis

### Phosphocreatine
- Produces ATP very quickly by adding a phosphate to ADP
- Allows muscle contraction to occur a little longer
- Phosphocreatine cannot supply energy directly to the muscle so instead it regenerated ATP which can.
- Variations in levels of Phosphocreatine depend on the following factors:
    - [[Natural Selection#Variation|Genetics]]
    - Fitness
    - Sex
    - Ethnicity
    - Metabolism
    - Number of fast/slow twitch muscle fibres.
