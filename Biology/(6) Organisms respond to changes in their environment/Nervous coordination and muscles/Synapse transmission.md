## Synapse
- Synapses are the gaps between the end of the axon of one neurone and the dendrite of another
- Action potentials are transmitted across synapses via the use of neurotransmitters 

## Function of a synapse
- Action potential arrives at the synaptic knob. Depolarization leads to the opening of Ca2+ which causes Ca2+ to diffuse into the synaptic knob
- Vesicles containing neurotransmitter move towards and fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Neurotransmitter is released to the synaptic cleft.
- Neurotransmitter diffuses down the concentration gradient, across synaptic cleft, to post synaptic membrane. Neurotransmitter binds to complimentary receptors on the surface of the post synaptic membrane.
- Na+ ion channels on the post synaptic membrane open and Na+ diffuses in, if enough diffuses in above a threshold, the post synaptic neurone becomes depolarized
- Neurotransmitter is degraded and released from the receptor, the Na+ channels close and the post synaptic neurone can re-establish a resting potential. The neurotransmitter is transported back into the presynaptic neurone where it is recycled.

## Summation
- Summation is the rapid build up of neurotransmitters in the synapse to help generate an action potential by 2 methods:
	- Spatial summation: Many different neurons collectively trigger a new action potential by combining their signals
	- Temporal summation: Repeated neurone firing over short period to build up neurotransmitter and surpass threshold 

## Inhibitory synapse
- Release chloride ions and cause potassium ions to move out
- Causes hyperpolarisation which decreases the chances of an action potential

## Neuromuscular junction
- Occurs between motor neurone and a muscle
- Is only exitatory
- Is the end point of an action potential
- Acetylcholine binds to receptors on muscle membrane
