- Receptors have 2 important features

###### Specificity
- Receptors only respond to specific stimuli. Examples of these stimuli include:
    - Light.
    - Temperature.
    - Pressure.
- This means that a receptor that responds to light will not respond to temperature or pressure.

###### Generator Potentials
- Receptors connect with sensory neurones. When stimulated, the receptor creates a generator potential in the sensory neurone.
- An example where stimulation of the receptor creates a generator potential is in the Pacinian corpuscle.

## The Pacinian Corpuscle
- The Pacinian corpuscle is a mechanoreceptor found in the skin.
- Mechanoreceptors respond to changes in pressure to establish a generator potential.
- The receptor reacts in the following way:

###### Resting Potential
- The Pacinian corpuscle consists of concentric rings of connective tissue that surround a sensory neurone.
- When the corpuscle is not being stimulated, it is at resting state.
- At resting state, the charge inside the neurone is more negative than outside (-70mV). This is because there are more Na+ ions outside the neurone than inside.
- A difference in charge across the cell membrane is called the potential difference.

###### Stimulation of the Receptor
- When pressure is applied to the Pacinian corpuscle, the rings of connective tissue apply pressure on the sensory neurone.
- The sensory neurone has stretch mediated Na+ channels, these channels normally restrict the movement of Na+ ions.
- Applied pressure causes the stretch-mediated Na+ channels to open.

###### Generator Potential
- Na+ ions flood into the sensory neurone through the open Na+ channels.
- There are now more Na+ ions inside the neurone than outside.
- The charge inside the neurone becomes more positive than outside, so the potential difference has changed.
- The generator potential has been established.

###### Action Potential
- If the generator potential reaches the threshold level (about -50mV) then an action potential is produced in the sensory neurone.
