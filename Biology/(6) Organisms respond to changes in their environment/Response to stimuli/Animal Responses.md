- Simple animals respond to stimuli to increase their chance of survival.
- This allows them to maintain a favourable environment.
- There are two ways in which simple animals respond:

###### Taxis
- The stimulus is positively or negatively directional, e.g. light.
- E.g. Woodlice move away from a light source.
    - Dark environments (e.g. under stones) are favourable for woodlice to protect them from predators.
    - Being able to detect the direction of light and move away helps woodlice locate a more favourable habitat.

###### Kinesis
- The stimulus is non-directional, e.g. humidity.
- E.g. Woodlice move more slowly and turn less in high humidity but move faster and turn more in low humidity.
    - Damp environments are favourable for woodlice to reduce water loss.
    - When woodlice detect a drier environment they move more. This increases the chance woodlice will find a more favourable habitat.
    - When woodlice detect a damper environment they move less. This ensures the woodlice stay in the more favourable habitat.

## Choice Chambers
- Choice chambers can be used to study how animals respond to environmental stimuli.
- In this experiment, four different conditions are created to see how woodlice respond to light and humidity.

###### Step 1 - Build Choice Chamber
- Divide a petri dish base into two halves with a divider between them.
- Place damp filter paper into one half and nothing into the other half. Place a piece of fine mesh on top.
- Cover half the petri dish lid with black card and leave the other half as transparent.

###### Step 2 - Add Woodlice
- Place 10 woodlice in the centre of the mesh.
- Put the petri dish lid on top of the petri dish base so that four different environments are created:
    - Dark and damp.
    - Dark and dry.
    - Light and damp.
    - Light and dry.

###### Step 3 - Collect Results
- After 10 minutes, remove the lid and record the number of woodlice in each quarter.

###### Step 4 - Repeat the Experiment
- Carefully move the woodlice back to the centre of the fine mesh and repeat the experiment two more times.
- The same experiment could be replicated using a maze.
