- Reflex responses are an automatic response to a stimulus.
###### They are quick, automatic, and protective
- Reflexes are quick and automatic.
- They often help an organism respond quickly to a harmful stimulus, e.g. heat.
- The information is not processed in the brain and no decision is made about the response.
###### Reflex arc
- The pathway of neurones involved in a reflex response is called the reflex arc.
- There are three types of neurone involved in the reflex arc:
    - Sensory.
    - Relay.
    - Motor.
- For example: The hand withdrawal reflex which causes you to quickly move away from hot objects

## Reflex Arc
- An example of a reflex arc is when a person withdraws their hand from a hot object. The steps in a reflex arc are:
###### Detection
- Thermoreceptors in the skin detect the heat stimulus.
###### Sensory neurone
- Sensory neurone carries impulse from thermoreceptors to relay neurone in the spinal cord.
###### Relay neurone
- Relay neurone carries impulse to motor neurone.
###### Motor neurone
- Motor neurone carries impulse to effectors (muscles in arm).
###### Response
- Arm moves away from hot object.
