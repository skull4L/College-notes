- Plants are not mobile so they must regulate growth in response to directional stimuli. These are known as tropisms

### Phototropism
- Phototropism is growth in response to direction of light:
    - Shoots are positively phototropic so they grow towards light.
    - Roots are negatively phototropic so they grow away from light.

### Gravitropism
- Gravitropism is growth in response to direction of gravity:
    - Shoots are negatively gravitropic so they grow upwards (away from the gravitational pull).
    - Roots are positively gravitropic so they grow downwards (towards the gravitational pull).

### Indoleacetic Acid (IAA)
- IAA is a type of auxin that controls the tropic response in plants.

- IAA can be transported over short distances (by diffusion or active transport) and longer distances (in the phloem) around the plant.
- When a plant detects directional stimuli, IAA is transported to different parts of the plant.
    - This creates an uneven distribution of IAA.
- Where the distribution of IAA is uneven, a directional growth response occurs.
- IAA causes different responses depending on what part of the plant it accumulates in:
    - IAA causes shoot cells to elongate.
    - IAA inhibits root cells from elongating.

### Phototropism in Shoots
- Shoots are positively phototropic.
- If a shoot is exposed to an uneven light source, IAA is transported to the more shaded part.
- A higher concentration of IAA in the shaded parts cause cells in the shaded area to elongate.
- Cell elongation causes the shoot to bend towards the light.

### Phototropism in Roots
- Roots are negatively phototropic.
- If a root is exposed to an uneven light source, IAA is transported to the more shaded part.
- A higher concentration of IAA in the shaded parts inhibits cell elongation on the shaded part.
- The root bends away from the light.

### Gravitropism in Shoots
- Shoots are negatively gravitropic.
- If a shoot is exposed to an uneven gravitational pull, IAA is transported to the underside (closer to the pull of gravity).
- A higher concentration of IAA in the underside cause cells in the underside to elongate.
- Cell elongation causes the shoot to bend away from the gravitational pull.

### Gravitropism in Roots
- Roots are positively gravitropic.
- If a root is exposed to an uneven gravitational pull, IAA is transported to the underside (closer to the pull of gravity).
- A higher concentration of IAA in the underside inhibits cell elongation on the lower side.
- The root bends towards the gravitational pull.
