- Skeletal muscles are ==antagonistic.== This means that they always occur in pairs that act against each other.
- They can only contract and relax, ==they cannot push.==

### Structure of actin and myosin molecules and their arrangement
Each muscle fibre is made up of myofibrils. Myofibrils are made up of 2 protein filaments
    - Actin which is thinner and consists of 2 strands twisted around each other
    - Mysosin which is thicker and consists of long rod shaped tails with bulbous heads that projects to the side

### Sarcomere structure
