- Skeletal muscles are ==antagonistic.== This means that they always occur in pairs that act against each other.
- They can only contract and relax, ==they cannot push.==

### The gross structure of the skeletal muscle
![[Pasted image 20221114094506.png]]

### Structure of actin and myosin molecules and their arrangement
Each muscle fibre is made up of myofibrils. Myofibrils are made up of 2 protein filaments
    - Actin which is thinner and consists of 2 strands twisted around each other
    - Mysosin which is thicker and consists of long rod shaped tails with bulbous heads that projects to the side

### Sarcomere structure

When the sarcomere contacts:
    - I band becomes narrower
    - Z lines move closer together
    - H zone becomes narrower
    - A band stays the same width

- The decrease in length of the sarcomere is caused when the Z lines move closer together causing the actin filaments to slide between the myosin, the H zone becomes narrower

### Myofibril contraction
- Head of myosin bind to the actin and pulls the actin
- Myosin detaches from the actin and moves further along the actin
- This uses ATP

- The actin filament is formed from a helix of actin sub-units. Each contains a binding site for the myosin heads.
- Tropomyosin (shown in blue) is wound around the actin.
- It moves out of the way when calcium ions bind so allow the myosin to bind to the actin (cross bridge formation)
