- Homeostasis is the maintaining of constant internal conditions in the body despite external changes
- Examples:
    - Body temperature
    - Blood glucose concentration
    - Blood salt concentration
    - Water potential of blood
    - Blood pressure
    - Carbon dioxide concentration
- Stages of homeostatic control
    - The optimum point - The 'norm'.
    - A receptor - which detects the stimulus of any deviation.
    - A coordinator - which coordinates information from various sources.
    - An effector - brings about the corrective measures needed to return to the 'norm'.
    - Feedback mechanism - a receptor detects a stimulus created by a change to the system and the effector brings the appropriate response.

### Negative Feedback
- Is the process that brings about a reversal of any change in conditions
- It ensures that an optimum steady state can be maintained, as the internal environment is returned to its original set of conditions after any change which is essential for homeostasis
- Negative feedback mechanisms involve
    - Deviation of a factor from its normal value or 'set point'
    - Receptors that detect any deviations from the norm
    - Effectors that are activated by the receptors and correct the factor and return the system to its set point

### Positive Feedback
- Deviation from the optimum causes a change that results in an even greater deviation from the norm, this is less common

### Ectotherms
- Body temperature fluctuates with external temperature
- Fish, reptiles, amphibians or invertebrates

### Endotherms
- Generate their heat metabolically
- Maintain a constant internal body temperature higher than the external environment
- Mammals, birds (warm blooded)
