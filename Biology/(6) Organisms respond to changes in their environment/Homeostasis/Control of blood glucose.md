- Glycogenesis - Glucose is converted to glycogen
- Glycogenolysis - Glycogen is converted into glucose
- Gluconeogenesis - Non carbohydrates are converted into glucose

>How does maintaining a constant body temperature allow metabolic reactions in cells to proceed with maximum efficiency?

- Optimum body temperature for humans is approx 37Â°C for enzymes
- Above the optimum denatures the enzymes
- Shape of active site changes
- Substrate can no longer bind to the active site
- Less kinetic energy of molecules
- Fewer enzyme substrate complexes formed
