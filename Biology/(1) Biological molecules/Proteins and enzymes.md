## Amino acids
![[Pasted image 20230330104548.png]]
- Amino acids are the monomers of proteins
- Polymers of amino acids are called polypeptides and are bonded by peptide bonds using a condensation reaction

## Protein structure
- There are 4 levels of protein structure:
	- Primary structure: the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain
	- Secondary structure: Bending or folding of the primary structure to form an alpha helix or beta pleated sheet respectively, this is held together by hydrogen bonds
	- Tertiary structure: Folded further to form unique 3D structure held together by ionic, hydrogen and disulphide bonds. This 3D shape is determined by the primary structure and is what gives a protein its use
	- Quarternary structure: A protein which is made up of multiple polypeptide chains

## Enzymes
- Enzymes are tertiary structure proteins which lower the activation energy of the reactions that they catalyse
- The active site of a specific enzyme is unique and comlimentary to a specific reaction
- The induced fit model is used to explain how enzymes function
	- It states that the enzyme active site changes shape to mould around the substrate
	- When the enzyme-substrate complex occurs, the moulding causes strain to be applied to the substate bonds which lowers the activation energy of the reaction
- There are 5 factors that control the rate of enzme action
	- Temperature: Lower temperature causes lower kinetic energy which leads to less collisions, high temperatures cause enzymes to denature as the active site changes shape making them useless
	- pH: Too high or too low pH can cause bonds in tertiary structure to change causing active site to denature making the enzymes useless
	- Substrate concentration: Insufficient substrate leads to fewer collisions which causes the rate of reaction to slow, high concentration leads to all active sites being used up so rate no longer increases	
	- Enzyme concentration: Insufficient enzyme leads to fewer collisions which causes the rate of reaction to slow, high concentration leads to all substrate being used up so rate no longer increases
	- Inhibitors:
		- Competitive inhibitors: Same shape as substrate so competes for active sites with substrate, lots of substrate can lead to inhibitor being outcompeted
		- Non-competitive inhibitors: Binds to the allosteric site abd causes the active site to change shape making the enzyme useless and preventing the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes
