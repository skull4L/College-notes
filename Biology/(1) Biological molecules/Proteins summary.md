## Amino acids
![[Pasted image 20230330104548.png]]
- Amino acids are the monomers of proteins
- Polymers of amino acids are called polypeptides and are bonded by peptide bonds using a condensation reaction

## Protein structure
- There are 4 levels of protein structure:
	- Primary structure: the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain
	- Secondary structure: Bending or folding of the primary structure to form an alpha helix or beta pleated sheet respectively, this is held together by hydrogen bonds
	- Tertiary structure: Folded further to form unique 3D structure held together by ionic, hydrogen and disulphide bonds. This 3D shape is determined by the primary structure and is what gives a protein its use
	- Quarternary structure: A protein which is made up of multiple polypeptide chains

## Enzymes
- Enzymes are tertiary structure proteins which lower the activation energy of the reactions that they catalyse
- The active site of a specific enzyme is unique and comlimentary to a specific reaction
