- Epigenetics is the control of transcription and translation of genetic code. This essentially means that epigenetics is the control of what genes are expressed in the phenotype.
- Epigenetics is influenced by a multitude of factors including diet, stress and toxins
- No changes to the base sequence of the DNA occur here

## The epigenome
- DNA and histones are covered in chemicals often referred to as tags
- These chemical tags form what is known as the epigenome
- This epigenome determines the shape of the DNA-histone complex
- For example inactive genes are tightly packed insuring that they arent read
    - This is called epigenetic silencing
- As well as this it can cause active genes to be unwrapped making it easier for transcription
- Unlike genetic code, the epigenome is flexible and therefore can be changed in response to environmental factors
- This allows certain genes to be switched on or off to respond to different environmental changes

- The epigenome acts as a sort of cellular memory, it is the accumulation of all the signals a cell has received over its lifetime
- During fetal development nutrients from the mother shape the epigenome
- After birth the epigenome is largely affected by envronmental factors
- These environmental stimulants cause proteins to transfer signals between eachother, eventually reaching a transcriptional factor which attaches to specific DNA bases. 
- This causes one of the following results:
    - Acetylation of histones resulting in either activation or inhibition of genes
    - Methylation of DNA by attracting enzymes that can add or remove methyl groups.

## The DNA-histone complex
- Where this association is weaker, the DNA-histone complex is less condensed and is therefore more accessible to transcription factors. It is on.
- Where this association is stronger, the DNA-histone complex is more condensed and is therefore not accessible by transcription factors. It is off.
- Condensation of the DNA-histone complex therefore controls transcription and is controlled by acetylation of histones or by methylation of DNA

## Decreased acetylation of associated histones
- Acetylation is the process whereby an acetyl group is transferred to a molecule
- In this case the group donating the acetyl group is acetylcoenzyrne A
- Decreased acetylation increases the positive charges on histones and therefore increases their attraction to the phosphate groups of DNA.
- The association between DNA and histones is stronger, and the DNA is not accessible to transcription factors, here the gene is switched off

## Increased methylation of DNA
- Methylation is the addition of a methyl group (CH3) to a molecule.
- In this case the methyl group is added LO the cytosine bases of DNA.
- Methylation normally inhibits the transcription of genes in two ways: 
    - Preventing the binding of transcriptional factors to the DNA 
    - Attracting proteins that condense the DNA-histone complex (by inducing deacetylation of the histones) making the DNA inaccessible to transcription factors.

## Epigenetics and inheritance
- Contrary to past theories, it is now accepted that epigenetic inheritance takes place
- It was thought that during development epigenetic tags were erased in order to return cells to a genetic ''clean slate''.
- However, a few epigenetic tags are able to survive and be passed from parent to offspring

## Epigenetics and disease
- Epigenetic changes can be responsible for certain diseases.
- Alteration of the epigenetic processes can cause abnormal activation or silencing of genes
- These diseases include cancer where activation of inactive (or vice versa)  genes causes issues
- We have seen that epigenetic changes do not alter the sequence of bases in DNA. 
- They can, however, increase the incidence of mutations. 
- Some active genes normally help repair DNA and so prevent cancers. 
- In people with various types of inherited cancer, it is found that increased methylation of these genes has led to these protective genes being switched off. 
- As a result, damaged base sequences in DNA are not repaired and so can lead to cancer.

## Treating diseases with epigenetic therapy
- Epigenetic treatments can be used to counteract the changes caused by changes to the epigenome
- These treatments use drugs to inhibit certain enzymes involved in either histone acetylation or DNA methylation.
- For example, drugs that inhibit enzymes that cause DNA methylarion can reactivate genes that have been silenced.
- Epigenetic therapy must be specifically targeted on cancer cells. If the drugs were to affect normal cells they could activate gene transcription and make them cancerous.
- They can also be used in the development of diagnostic tests to help detect the early stages of diseases such as cancer, brain disorders and arthritis.
- These tests can identify the level of DNA methylation and histone acetylation at an early stage of disease

## The effect of RNA interference on gene expression
- In eukaryotes and some prokaryotes the translation of mRNA produced by a gene can be inhibited by breaking mRNA down before its coded information can be translated into a polypeptide.
- One type of small RNA molecule that may be involved is small interfering RNA (siRNA). 
- The mechanism involving small double· stranded sections of siRNA operates as follows.
    - An enzyme cuts large double-stranded molecules of RNA into smaller sections called small interfering RNA (siRNA)
    - One of the 2 siRNA strands combines with an enzyme.
    - The siRNA molecule guides the enzyme to a messenger RNA molecule by pairing up its bases with the complementary ones on a section of rhe mRNA molecule 
    - Once in position, the enzyme cuts the mRNA inro smaller sections
    - The mRNA is no longer capable of being translated into a polypeptide. • This means that the gene has not been expressed, that is. it has been blocked
