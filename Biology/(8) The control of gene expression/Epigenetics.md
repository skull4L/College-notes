- Epigenetics is the control of transcription and translation of genetic code. This essentially means that epigenetics is the control of what genes are expressed in the phenotype.
- Epigenetics is influenced by a multitude of factors including diet, stress and toxins

## The epigenome
- DNA and histones are covered in chemicals often reffered to as tags
- These chemical tags form what is known as the epigenome
- This epigenome determines the shape of the DNA-histone complex
- For example inactive genes are tightly packed insuring that they arent read
    - This is called epigenetic silencing
- As well as this it can cause active genes to be unwrapped making it easier for transcription
- Unlike genetic code, the epigenome is flexible and therefore can be changed in response to environmental factors
- This allows certain genes to be switched on or off to respond to different environmental changes
