- Epigenetics is the control of transcription and translation of genetic code. This essentially means that epigenetics is the control of what genes are expressed in the phenotype.
- Epigenetics is influenced by a multitude of factors including diet, stress and toxins

## The epigenome
- DNA and histones are covered in chemicals often reffered to as tags
- These chemical tags form what is known as the epigenome
- This epigenome determines the shape of the DNA-histone complex
- For example inactive genes are tightly packed insuring that they arent read
    - This is called epigenetic silencing
- As well as this it can cause active genes to be unwrapped making it easier for transcription
- Unlike genetic code, the epigenome is flexible and therefore can be changed in response to environmental factors
- This allows certain genes to be switched on or off to respond to different environmental changes
- The epigenome acts as a sort of cellular memory, it is the accumulation of all the signals a cell has received over its lifetime
- During fetal development nutrients from the mother shape the epigenome
- After birth the epigenome is largely affected by envronmental factors
- These environmental stimulants cause proteins to transfer signals between eachother, eventually reaching a transcriptional factor which attaches to specific DNA bases. 
- This causes one of the following results:
    - Acetylation of histones resulting in either activation or inhibition of genes
    - Methylation of DNA by attracting enzymes that can add or remove methyl groups.

## The DNA-histone complex
- Where this association is weaker, the DNA-histone complex is less condensed and is therefore more accessible to transcription factors. It is on.
- Where this association is stronger, the DNA-histone complex is more condensed and is therefore not accessible by transcription factors. It is off.
- Condensation of the DNA-histone complex therefore controls transcription and is controlled by acetylation of histones or by methylation of DNA

## Decreased acetylation of associated histones
- Acetylation is the process whereby an acetyl group is transferred to a molecule
- In this case the group donating the acetyl group is acetylcoenzyrne A
- Decreased acetylation increases the positive charges on histones and therefore increases their attraction to the phosphate groups of DNA.
- The association between DNA and histones is stronger, and the DNA is not accessible to transcription factors, here the gene is switched off

## Increased methylation of DNA
- Methylation is the addition of a methyl group (CH3) to a molecule.
- In this case the methyl group is added LO the cytosine bases of DNA.
- Methylation normally inhibits the transcription of genes in two ways: 
    - Preventing the binding of transcriptional factors to the DNA 
    - Attracting proteins that condense the DNA-histone complex (by inducing deacetylation of the histones) making the DNA inaccessible to transcription factors.

## Epigenetics and inheritance
- Contrary to past theories, it is now accepted that epigenetic inheritance takes place
