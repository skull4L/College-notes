- A gene is a section of DNA which codes for a protein
1) mRNA strand is produced by transcription
2) Codon on the mRNA matches the anticodon on the tRNA
3) The tRNA carries a specific amino acid
4) Specific order of amino acids determines the protein
5) Protein may be modified by the Golgi
6) Protein has complex tertiary/quaternary structure
- A gene that is expressed in the phenotype is known as gene expression

## Gene Expression: Regulation of transcription and translation
>Transcriptional factors = stimulate transcription of a gene

- Gene expression controlled by transcription happens:

1) Transcription factors move from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (for transcription to work the gene needs to switched on by transcriptional factors)
2) Each transcription factor has a site that binds to a specific base sequence of the DNA in a nucleus
3) When it binds, it causes the region of DNA to start transcription 
4) mRNA is produced and the information is carries is the translated into sequence of amino acids coding for a particular polypeptide. 
5) When a gene is not expressed (Le. switched off) the site on the transcriptional factor that binds to the DNA is not active.
6) If the site on the transcriptional factor binding to the DNA is inactive it cannot cause

transcription and therefore translation does not take place a polypeptide chain is not synthesised

## A transcriptional factor
- Hormones such as oestrogen can switch on a gene:
- Oestrogen can switch on a gene and therefore start transcription. It does this by combining with a receptor site on the transcriptional factor. This activates the DNA binding site by causing it to change shape.

###### Describe how oestrogen stimulates the expression of a gene:
- Oestrogen diffuses through the phospholipid part of the cell surface membrane into the cytoplasm of a cell (it is lipid soluble). 
- It binds with a site on the receptor part of a transcriptional factor. 
- Oestrogen changes the shape of the DNA binding site on the transcription factor so that it can now bond with DNA.
- The transcriptional factor now enters the nucleus through a nuclear pore and binds with the specific DNA base sequence, which is known as the promoter region. 
- This stimulates RNA polymerase and transcription of the gene that makes up that portion of DNA begins.
- The gene is now expressed
