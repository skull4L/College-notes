## Tumour suppressor genes
- Can lead to the development of tumours
- Main function is to:
    - Slow down cell division
    - Cause cells with damaged DNA to be destroyed

## Formation of a tumour
- Increased methylation of tumour suppressant gene
- Mutation in the tumour suppressant gene
- No transcription of the gene
- No gene expression
- Results in uncontrolled cell division causing a tumour
- Some cancers such as lung cancer and breast cancer are inherited mutations of the tumour suppressant gene

## Proto-oncogenes
- Regulate cell division by coding for growth factors
- They only divide when it is necessary for growth and repair

## Mutation of a proto-oncogene
- Proto-oncogene mutates to form an oncogene
- This codes for excessive growth factors and for mutated receptor proteins
- Cell division will be uncontrolled, cells divide too frequently
- The receptor proteins on the cell surface membrane is activated permanently so that cell division happens without the growth factors
