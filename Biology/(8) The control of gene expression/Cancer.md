## Tumour suppressor genes
- Can lead to the development of tumours
- Main function is to:
    - Slow down cell division
    - Cause cells with damaged DNA to be destroyed

## Formation of a tumour
- Increased methylation of tumour suppressant gene
- Mutation in the tumour suppressant gene
- No transcription of the gene
- No gene expression
- Results in uncontrolled cell division causing a tumour
- Some cancers such as lung cancer and breast cancer are inherited mutations of the tumour suppressant gene

## Proto-oncogenes
- Regulate cell division by coding for growth factors
- They only divide when it is necessary for growth and repair

## Mutation of a proto-oncogene
- Proto-oncogene mutates to form an oncogene
- This codes for excessive growth factors and for mutated receptor proteins
- Cell division will be uncontrolled, cells divide too frequently
- The receptor proteins on the cell surface membrane is activated permanently so that cell division happens without the growth factors

## The effect of RNA interference on gene expression
- In eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, the translation of mRNA produced by a gene can be inhibited by breaking mRNA down before its coded information can be translated into a polypeptide. 
- A small RNA molecule that can work in this way is called small interfering RNA (siRNA).
- The mechanism involving small stranded sections of siRNA working in this way can be explained in the following ways:
    - Double stranded RNA is broken down by an enzyme into small siRNA
    - One of the 2 strands of siRNA combines with an enzyme
    - The siRNA strand pairs with the complimentary bases on a mRNA strand
    - The enzyme then cuts the mRNA into smaller sections
    - The mRNA cannot be translated so into a polypeptide so the gene is not expressed
