- The ability to find the base sequence of stretches of DNA has become faster and more efficient through the development of new sequencing methods that are continuously being improved and updated. 
- These methods have allowed scientists to sequence the genomes of many organisms, including humans. 
- Sequencing the genomes of simpler organisms has allowed scientists to increase their understanding of these organisms' proteomes. 
- There are many applications for this knowledge and understanding, including the development of new vaccines. 
- In higher organisms, it is harder to work out the proteome because of the presence of non-coding DNA and regulatory genes.

###### What is the genome?
- An entire set of DNA and all the genes in an organism 

###### Human Genome Project
- Has successfully identified, mapped and sequenced the entire human genome. 
- Makes it possible to use this information for various purposes, e.g. Research into gene regulation and functioning. 
- Construct gene probes for identifying particular genes and abnormalities 

##### Distinguish between the genome and proteome
- Genome is sequence of bases in DNA of an organism; proteome is the proteins coded for by the DNA. 

###### Explain how an understanding the genome of simple organisms can lead to an understanding of their proteomes
- From the sequence of bases we can work out the amino acids/proteins coded for, three bases code for one amino acid; gives primary sequence of proteins; most of the DNA codes for proteins. 
- Also, in bacteria and viruses, identifying the protein antigens on their surface can help in the development of vaccine to prevent disease.

###### Why is it harder for scientists to work out the proteome of a higher organism than the proteome of a simpler organism?
- Non-coding DNA present in higher organism; e.g. introns/regulatory genes/promoter sequences but simple organisms do not have much non-coding DNA, so it is easier to determine their proteome from the DNA sequence of their genome. 

###### Developing a new sequencing method
- Sangar method-sample of DNA was tagged with radioactive bases, separated into four lanes on a gel and was allowed to move. 
- X-ray film was produced which showed the position of the DNA fragments, each lane representing one of the 4 bases. 
- The DNA sequence was worked out by combining the results in each lane. But this was really time consuming.
