## Cell differentiation and specialisation
- Different life processes require slightly different cellular structure, enzymes and other proteins to function effectively
- This means that no single cell can be efficient at all processes
- The cells of multicellular organisms are each adapted to perform a particular action. It is said that they are differentiated
- All cells have the same genes in the body, however different genes are expressed depending on what the cell is designed to do
