## Cell differentiation and specialisation
- Different life processes require slightly different cellular structure, enzymes and other proteins to function effectively
- This means that no single cell can be efficient at all processes
- The cells of multicellular organisms are each adapted to perform a particular action. It is said that they are differentiated
- All cells have the same genes in the body, however different genes are expressed depending on what the cell is designed to do

###### Totipotent cell specialisation
- Totipotent cells become specialised during embryonic development.
- When the cells become specialised, only some genes in the cell are activated.
    - Only the activated genes are expressed.

###### Proteins in differentiation
- If a gene is expressed, it is transcribed into mRNA and translated into a protein.
- Differentiation happens as certain proteins are made.
- The presence of certain proteins means a cell has become specialised.

## Types of Stem Cell
- Stem cells are unspecialised cells. Unspecialised cells are capable of dividing and differentiating into any type of cell. There are four types of stem cell

###### Totipotent cells
- Totipotent cells exist for only a very limited time during embryonic development in mammals (the first few cell divisions).
- During development, totipotent cells translate only part of their DNA. This means that the cells remain unspecialised.
- Totipotent cells are able to produce any type of body cell, as well as cells of supportive structures such as the placenta.
- They are the most unspecialised stem cell and specialise into many different cell types.

###### Pluripotent cells
- Totipotent cells develop into pluripotent cells in embryos.
- Pluripotent cells are able to divide in unlimited numbers and produce any type of cell that makes up the body.
- Pluripotent cells can be used to treat human disorders.

###### Multipotent cells
- Multipotent cells are found in mature mammals.
- Multipotent cells can develop into a limited number of cell types.
    - E.g. Multipotent cells in the bone marrow can produce a range of blood cells.

###### Unipotent cells
- Unipotent cells are found in mature mammals.
- Unipotent cells can divide to produce new cells but can only produce one type of cell.
    - E.g. Cardiomyocytes are unipotent cells that can produce new muscle cells.
