## Substitution of bases
- When a nucleotide in the DNA is replaced by another with a different base, there are 3 possible consequences:
    -   formation of stop codon that stops polypeptide chain. The protein will not perform its original function.
    -   Formation of amino acid so protein structure will change and it might not function normally.
    -   Formation of different codon but same amino acid as DNA code is degenerate. As a result, the mutation has no effect.
- The order of DNA bases in a gene determines the order of amino acids in a protein

## Deletion of bases
- The deletion of bases results in a frame shift and the gene is read wrong resulting in a different protein that functions differently.

## Addition of bases
- Extra base inserted into sequence, also results in a frame shift, but to the right. If a multiple of three is added there is no frame shift.

## Duplication of bases
- One or more bases duplicated, frame shift to the right.

## Inversion of bases
- Group of bases are inverted. This affects the amino acid sequence as a result.

## Translocation of bases
- Group of bases become inserted into the DNA sequence of a different chromosome. This results in an abnormal phenotype and the effects include development of some forms of cancer and also reduced fertility.

## Causes of mutations
- Outside factors that increase the basic mutation rate are called mutagenic agents or mutagens, these include:
    -   High energy ionising radiation, e.g. alpha and beta particles.
    -   Chemicals, for e.g. nitrogen dioxide, benzopyrene (from tobacco smoke), etc.,
