- Recombinant DNA is the DNA of 2 different organisms
- The required gene is taken from one organism and inserted into the DNA/chromosome of another to produce recombinant DNA
- Examples include the transfer of:
    - Human insulin gene into the bacterium Escherichia coli B-carotene gene into rice
    - Pesticide-resistant genes into crops
- The purpose of such gene transfers is either to: 
    - Improve the organism
    - Make a product that is not normally made by the organism

## Process
1) Isolation - DNA fragments that have the gene for the desired protein
2) Insertion of the DNA fragments into the vector 
3) Transformation - transfer of DNA into the host cells
4) Identification of the host cells that have successfully taken up the gene by the use of gene markers
5) Growth/cloning of the population of host cells

###### Isolation
- Conversion of mRNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase 
- Using restriction endonuclease to cut fragments containing the desired gene from DNA
- Creating the gene in a gene machine based on a known protein structure

###### Conversion of mRNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase
- mRNA coding for insulin is taken from the B cells
- mRNA acts as template on which a single stranded complementary copy of DNA (cDNA) is formed using reverse transcriptase enzyme 
- The cDNA is then isolated by hydrolysis of the mRNA with an enzyme
- DNA polymerase enzyme is used to make double stranded DNA
- Copy of the human insulin gene is made

###### Restriction endonuclease
- Enzyme that recognises and cuts DNA at a specific base sequence called a recognition sequence

## The gene machine
- Desired sequence of nucleotide bases of a gene for the protein are produced.
- Bioinformatics - The desired sequence of nucleotide bases for the gene is fed into the computer
- Sequence is checked for biosafety and biosecurity to make sure it meets international standards and ethical requirements
- Oligonucleotides are overlapping single strands of nucleotides are designed by the computer which can be assembles into the desired gene
- In an automated process, each of the oligonucleotides is assembled by adding one nucleotide at a time in the required sequence
- The oligonucleotides are then joined to make a gene


###### Antibiotic resistance markers
- A tequnique called replica plating is carried out
- Uses the other antibiotic resistance gene in the plasmid (the gene that was cut in order to insert the desired gene)
- Therefore this antibiotic resistance to tetracycline no longer works
- This allows us to identify which plasmid has the required gene by treating them with tetracycline
- The problem with this is that this destroys the plasmids with the required gene
- To overcome this, replica plating is carried out. Living colonies of bacteria containing desired gene can be identified
