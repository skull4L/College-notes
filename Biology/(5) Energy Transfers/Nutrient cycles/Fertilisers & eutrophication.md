## Fertilisers
- Fertilisers replace nutrients lost from the soil during harvesting and removing livestock to help maximise yields in agriculture.
###### Agricultural impacts on soil
- Agriculture leads to depleted levels of nutrients in the soil (e.g. nitrogen and phosphates).
- This is because when crops are removed for harvest, they are not decomposed and the nutrients are not returned to the soil for reuse.
- Removing livestock for slaughter also decreases nutrient levels because they are not replaced by decomposition.
###### Using fertilisers
- Fertilisers can be used to replace the nutrients (e.g nitrogen and phosphate) lost through agriculture.
- Increasing nutrient levels by fertilisers allows farming to continue without negative impacts on the crop or livestock quality.

## Types of Fertilisers
- There are two types of fertiliser
###### Natural fertilisers
- Natural fertilisers (e.g. composted food waste, manure) are organic.
- Natural fertilisers are taken from organic matter and used to replace nutrients.
###### Artificial fertilisers
- Artificial fertilisers (e.g. ammonium nitrate) are inorganic.
- Artificial fertilisers are produced specifically for replacing nutrients.

## Eutrophication
- Using fertilisers can have negative impacts on the environment. For example, eutrophication can happen when too much fertiliser is used. The process of eutrophication is:
###### Leaching and overflow
- Fertilisers that are sprayed onto fields can leach through the soil or flow into ponds, rivers and lakes.
    - Leaching is when water-soluble plant nutrients are lost from the soil.
- This causes a build up of nutrients in the water.
###### Algal overgrowth
- The excess of nutrients cause algae to rapidly grow on the surface of the water.
- As algae accumulate, light is prevented from reaching the plants in the water beneath.
###### Plant death
- The plants underneath the algae eventually die because there is insufficient light for them to photosynthesise.
###### Increase in numbers of bacteria
- Bacteria decompose the dead plants.
- As numbers of bacteria increase, the oxygen concentration in the water decreases.
- Fish and other organisms will now die because there is not enough oxygen.
