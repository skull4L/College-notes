## Phosphorus Cycle
- The phosphorus cycle shows how phosphate ions (PO43-) are transferred between organisms and their ecosystem and how micoorganisms influence each step.

###### Uptake of Phosphate Ions
- Phosphate ions are assimilated by plants because of the symbiotic relationship between the plant roots and mycorrhizae.
    - Mycorrhizae help to increase the rate of phosphate ion uptake.

###### Breakdown of Phosphate Ions
- As phosphate ions are transferred through the food chain, they are lost as waste products or when an organism dies.
- Saprobionts decompose waste and dead organisms through extracellular digestion.
- Phosphate ions are released into the soil and can be recycled for reuse in the cycle.

## Mycorrhizae
- Mycorrhizae are fungi that form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants.
- Mycorrhizae help plants absorb inorganic ions and water from the soil.

###### Structure
- The fungi associate with the roots using hyphae.
- Hyphae are long strands that extend from the cell body.

###### Function
- Hyphae increase the surface area of the plant root system.
    - This helps plants take up ions that are in short supply (e.g. phosphorus) and water at a faster rate.
