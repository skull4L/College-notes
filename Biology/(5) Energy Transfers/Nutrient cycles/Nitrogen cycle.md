## Nitrogen Cycle
The nitrogen cycle shows how nitrogen is transferred between organisms and their ecosystem. There are four steps in the nitrogen cycle, each of which involves bacteria:

###### Nitrogen Fixation
- Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is converted to ammonia (NH3) by nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil.
- Bacteria (e.g. *Rhizobia*) form a mutualistic relationship with leguminous plants by inhabiting their root nodules.
    - Leguminous plants (e.g. alfalfa, peas, beans) are a family of plants.
- The bacteria provide a source of ammonium ions for the plants and the plant provides sugars

###### Ammonification
- When an organism dies or produces waste (e.g. faeces), it is decomposed by saprobionts.
- This releases the nutrients contained inside.
- Saprobionts decompose the organisms' biomass by extracellular digestion and inorganic ammonium ions are released into the soil.
- Ammonification is a by-product of saprobiont nutrition.

###### Nitrification
- Ammonium ions that are released from ammonification are converted into nitrates by bacteria in the soil.
    - Nitrifying bacteria (e.g. *Nitrosomonas*) firstly convert NH4+ ions to nitrites.
    - Another bacteria (e.g. *Nitrobacter*) then convert nitrites to nitrates.

###### Denitrification
- Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates in the soil back into atmospheric nitrogen (N2).
- This takes place in anaerobic conditions (e.g waterlogged soils).

## Saprobionts
- Saprobionts are microorganisms (e.g. bacteria and fungi) that feed on dead or decaying organic matter. Saprobionts play an important role in decomposition and in recycling nutrients.

###### Importance
- Nutrient recycling is an important process in ecosystems because it allows the nutrients to be continuously reused.
- Nutrients are recycled in the nitrogen cycle by saprobionts.

###### Saprobiont Nutrition
- Saprobionts secrete enzymes onto the dead organic matter. This is called extracellular digestion.
    - The enzymes break down large, insoluble molecules into smaller, soluble molecules.
    - These smaller molecules can then be absorbed by the saprobiont.
- The saprobiont will then either store the molecules or use them in respiration.
