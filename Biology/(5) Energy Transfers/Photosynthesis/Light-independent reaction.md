- The products of the light-dependant reaction are used in the light-independent reaction to reduce glycerate 3-phosphate (GP)
- The light-independent reaction does not require light energy but cannot occur without the light dependant reaction taking place
- Takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast
    - It is adapted for this in a number of ways
        - Stromal fluid contains all the necessary enzymes and is membrane bound, allowing it to be distinctively different from the cytoplasm
        - Surrounds the grana so easy diffusion pathway
        - Contains both DNA and ribosomes so can quickly manufacture proteins involved in the light independent reaction
- It is referred to as the calvin cycle

### Stages
1. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the leaf and dissolves in water, then diffuses into the mesophyll cells. It then makes it to the stroma of the chloroplast
2. In the stroma the CO2 reacts with 5 carbon ribulose biphosphate (RuBP), catalysed by rubisco
3. This results in 2x 3 carbon glycerate-phosphate (GP)
4. Reduced NADP from the [[Light-dependent reaction]] is used to reduce GP into triose phosphate (TP) using ATP
5. NADP is reformed and returns to light dependant reaction to be reduced again by accepting protons
6. Some TP molecules convert into organic substances such as starch, cellulose, lipids, glucose, amino acids and nucleotides
7. Most TP is used to regenerate RuBP using ATP from the light dependant reaction
