* Photosynthesis is a series of reactions that uses solar energy to convert CO2 into carbohydrates.

>6CO2 + 6H2O → 6O2 + C6H12O6

* Chemical energy stored as carbohydrates can then be consumed by organisms for energy.

## Photosynthesis occurs in 2 separate stages in this order:
* [[Light-dependent reaction]]
* [[Light-independent reaction]]

### Light-dependent reaction
* The first stage of photosynthesis, initiated when a photon strikes a chlorophyll molecule in the chloroplast.

### Light-independent reaction
* The second stage of photosynthesis, does not require light energy. AKA ==the Calvin cycle.== Cannot occur without the light-dependent reaction.

## Chloroplasts
* Flattened organelles with ==double membrane== where photosynthesis occurs.

### Stroma
The space within the chloroplast is called the stroma, stored carbohydrates come in the form of starch grains which are found here.

### Thylakoids
* Thylakoids are fluid filled sacs stacked up within the chloroplasts,
    * These stacks of thylakoids form structures called grana.
    * Grana are linked together by thylakoid membranes. ==These structures are called lamellae.==
* Thylakoids contain photosynthetic pigments contain photosynthetic pigments.
* There are different types of photosynthetic pigments with each being more evolved to absorb different wavelengths of visible light.
* Examples of photosynthetic pigments include:
    * Chlorophyll a
    * Chlorophyll b
    * Carotene

### Photosystems
* Within thylakoid membranes, ==photosynthetic pigments are attached to proteins. These together are called a photosystem.==
* There are 2 types of photosystems used in photosynthesis:
    * Photosystem I (PS1)
    * Photosystem II (PSII)
* Both photosystems play an important role in the light-dependant reaction.
