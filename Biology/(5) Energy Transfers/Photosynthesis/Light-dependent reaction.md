## Photoionization of Chlorophyll
- Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll in the [[Photosysnthesis overview#Photosystems|photosystems.]] This is the first step in photosynthesis.
- ==Absorbing light energy excites the electrons within the photosystem.==
- The electrons are now in a more excited state. This causes them to be released from the Chlorophyll.
- The Chlorophyll is now considered to be photoionized
- The photoionization of chlorophyll also results in a release of energy.
- This energy is used in photosynthesis to drive 3 reactions:
    - **Photophosphorylation** - production of ATP from NADP
    - **Reduction** - production of reduced NADPH from NADP
    - **Photolysis** - splitting of water into protons, electrons and oxygen
- These 3 reactions are necessary for photosynthesis to take place.

## Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation
- Non-cyclic photophosphorylation produces reduced NADP and ATP.
    - Reduced NADP is produced when light is absorbed by [[Photosysnthesis overview#Photosystems|PSI.]]
- ==Electrons are not recycled== in non-cyclic photophosphorylation.
- Both types of photophosphorylation produce ATP.
- Only non-cyclic photophosphorylation produces reduced NADP and oxygen.
- ==non-cyclic photophosphorylation involves both PSI and PSII.==

### Photolysis
- Electrons lost from [[Light-dependent reaction#Photoionization of Chlorophyll|photoionization]] can be replaced by photolysis.
- In this process, ==light energy splits water into protons, electrons and oxygen.==
- The electrons can then replace those released when light is absorbed.

### Electron Transfer Chain
- ATP and reduced NADP are produced via an ==electron transfer chain.== electrons are transferred down this chain and protons pass across the membranes of chloroplasts against their concentration gradient.
- Light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll and the electrons are moved to a higher energy level.
- High-energy electrons are released from the chlorophyll and transferred to an electron carrier.
- Electron carriers are proteins located in the thylakoid membranes.
- When high-energy electrons are released they are transferred along a chain of electron carriers.
- The series of electron carriers is called the electron transport chain (ETC)

### The Proton Gradient
- As the electrons move down the ETC, they lose energy.
- This energy pumps protons from the [[Photosysnthesis overview#Stroma|stroma]] into the [[Photosysnthesis overview#Thylakoids|thylakoids.]] The protons are being transported against their concentration gradient and this requires energy.
- As protons build up inside the thylakoids, a proton gradient forms across the thylakoid membrane because ==the concentration of protons inside the thylakoids is greater than in the stroma.==

### Chemiosmosis
- The protons diffuse down the concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane through the ==ATP synthase enzyme.==
- As protons diffuse through the ATP synthase, energy is released.
- This energy converts ADP and inorganic phosphate to ATP.
- This process is called chemiosmosis.

### Reduced NADP
- When light energy is absorbed, high-energy electrons are released.
- ==Some electrons are transferred directly to NADP.== They are not passed along the ETC.
- The electrons react with a proton in the stroma to produce reduced NADP.

## Cyclic Photophosphorylation
- ==Cyclic photophosphorylation only involves PSI.==
- The process is initiated when light energy is absorbed by PSI.
- Light energy excites electrons in the chlorophyll of PSI and the electrons are moved to a higher energy level (they are high-energy electrons).
- This is [[Light-dependent reaction#Photoionization of Chlorophyll|photoionization]] of chlorophyll.

### Electron Transfer Chain
- High-energy electrons are released from the chlorophyll and transferred to an electron carrier.
- The electrons are transferred along a chain of electron carriers in the electron transport chain (ETC).
- Unlike in non-cyclic photophosphorylation, ==the electrons are not transferred from PSII to PSI.==
- Instead the electrons cycle continuously through the electron carriers to PSI.

### The Proton Gradient
- As the electrons move down the ETC, ==they lose energy.==
- This energy pumps protons from the stroma into the thylakoids.
    - This is the same as in non-cyclic photophosphorylation.
- As protons build up inside the thylakoids, a proton gradient forms across the thylakoid membrane.

### Chemiosmosis
- The protons diffuse down the concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane through the ==ATP synthase enzyme.==
- As protons diffuse through the ATP synthase, energy is released.
- This energy converts ADP and inorganic phosphate to ATP.
- This process is called chemiosmosis.

## Comparing Cyclic and Non-cyclic
- In cyclic photophosphorylation:
    - ATP is produced.
    - No reduced NADP is produced.
    - Electrons are continuously recycled.
    - Photolysis does not take place.
- In non-cyclic photophosphorylation:
    - ATP and reduced NADP are produced.
    - Electrons in PSII are replaced by photolysis.

## Photoionization of Chlorophyll
- Different pigments of chlorophyll absorb different wavelengths of light.
- Plants use different pigments as an adaptation to their environment.
    - E.g. Plants that typically grow in the shade use pigments that are well-adapted to wavelengths that can pass through other plants.
