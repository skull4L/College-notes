### Light dependant reaction
- Light strikes a chlorophyll molecule causing it to enter an excited state
- It releases an electron which passes down an electron transfer chain
- As it passes down the chain it loses energy, this energy is used to move protons against their concentration gradient into they thylakoid membranes
- Water is the final acceptor in the chain
- photohydrolyisis occurs which splits water into protons and electrons.
- the electrons replace those lost by the chlorophyll

### Light independent reaction
- Involves glycolysis and the krebs cycle
- water and co2 are converted into pyruvate in a multi step reaction.
- pyruvate enters the krebs cycle and flows twice to produce 32 ATP
