This allows warm blood to pass close to the skin surface through the blood capillaries. The heat from the blood is then radiated away from the body. Increased To evaporate water from the skin surface requires energy in the form sweating of heat. In hairless mammals e.g. humans sweating is an effective way of losing heat. In mammals with fur, cooling is achieved by the evaporation of water from the mouth and tongue during panting. The high latent of vaporisation of water makes sweating an efficient way of losing heat. Lowering of The hair erector muscles in the skin relax and the elasticity of the skin body hair causes them to flatten against the body. Behavioural Avoiding the heat of the day by sheltering in burrows and seeking out mechanisms shade help to prevent the body temperature from rising.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"eng","hash":"","size":0}
