Figure 2 illustrates this in relation to four types of frog gehavioural Mating is often preceded by courtship, which is stimulated by the colour or markings of the opposite sex, the call or particular actions of a mate. Any mutations which cause variations in these patterns may prevent mating, for example, if a female stickleback does not respond appropriately to the actions of the male, he ceases to court her Mechanical Anatomical differences may prevent mating occurring, for example, it may be physically impossible for the penis to enter the vagina in mammals Gametic The gametes may be prevented from meeting due to genetic or biochemical incompatibility. For instance, some pollen grains fail to germinate or grow when they land on a stigma of different genetic makeup. Some sperm are destroyed by chemicals in the female reproductive tract Hybrid Hybrids formed from the fusion of gametes from different sterility species are often sterile because they cannot produce viable gametes. For example, in a cross between a horse (2n=64)anda donkey (2n = 62) the resultant mule has 63 chromosomes. It is impossible for these chromosomes to pair up appropriately during meiosis and so the gametes formed are not viable and the mule is sterile I ..","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"eng","hash":"","size":0}
