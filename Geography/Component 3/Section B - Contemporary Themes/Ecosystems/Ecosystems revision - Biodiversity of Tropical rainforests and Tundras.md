### Tropical rainforest
- **Biodiversity**
    - **Flora and fauna**
        - Tropical rainforests make contain 50% of the species discovered on our planet despite the fact that they make up 7% of the land mass. This is due to the ecosystem's high diversity of flora due to the tropical climate which creates ideal growth conditions. 30-50m tall trees along with epiphytes dominate the canopy while highly adapted plants live in the low light understory. This variety creates a great variety of food sources and habitats within the ecosystem allowing for many animals to thrive. A huge variety of Insects, reptiles, birds and mammals can be found here, many of which are adapted to living in trees. 
    - **Nutrient cycling**
        - In Tropical rainforests most of the nutrients are locked up in the biomass. This is due to the tropical climate which catalyses the nutrient cycle which speeds up decomposition so nutrients can be quickly taken up by plants due to dense root structures.

- **Conservation**
    - **Local**
        - The Manu biosphere in Peru is an example of a local conservation strategy. It is a 17,000kmÂ² protected area of Amazon Rainforest. Afforestation here which is east of the Andes and 3000m above sea level. 19 different habitats have been protected.
    - **Global**
        - REDD+ scheme, by the UN. Gives Brazil funds to help reduce deforestation. Unsuccessful as Bolsonara (Brazil president) wants to develop Amazonia.
    - **Organisations involved**
        - UN, FSC (Forest stewardship council), WWF and other charities and government bodies are in the protection of tropical rainforests.

### Arctic Tundra
- **Biodiversity**
    - **Flora and fauna**
        - Just over 600 species of animals, lower levels of diversity but organisms are highly specialised. Small plants with shallow roots such as mosses and lichens are found here. Large herbivores such as reindeer, caribou and musk ox are common. These animals migrate south for the winter as during this time there is not enough vegetation for food.
    - **Nutrient cycling**
        - Very slow nutrient cycles due to extreme weather. Litter makes up the largest portion of the nutrients, as it cannot decay due to the cold.

- **Conservation**
    - **Local**
        - The Arctic council's Arctic monitoring and assessment programme (AMAP) documents on effects of climate change and pollution in the area
    - **Global**
        - International wildlife trade insures that trade does not threaten wildlife species, illegal wildlife worth $25 billion per year.
    - **Organisations involved**
        - UN, Arctic council.
