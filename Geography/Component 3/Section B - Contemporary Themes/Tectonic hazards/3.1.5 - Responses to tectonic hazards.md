- The best way to lessen the demographic impact (death toll) of volcanic eruptions is to monitor the volcano and to predict the eruption (Mount Sajurajima, Japan, Soufriere Hills, Monserrat, Mount Pinatubo, Philippines).  Good prediction can lead to effective evacuation, but it is not always possible (Lake Nyos, Cameroon).  However, there is little that can be done to prevent damage to property and the environment from some volcanic hazards (pyroclastic flows, lahars, ash fall, gases) but successful attempts have been made to divert lava flow (Etna, Heimaey).
