- **P waves**
    Are compression waves, they can move through water and are the fastest, move similar to how sound moves

- **S waves**
    Vibrate at right angles, similar to how waves move in water. They are half the speed of P waves and cannot move through liquids

- **L waves**
    Lateral vibration. no vertical displacement, only occur near the surface and are the slowest waves

- **Rayleigh waves**
    Have both vertical and horizontal movement, is extremely destructive and even more so confusing.

Earthquake waves can help seismologists to determine the different layers of the earth, this is due to the fact that P waves and S waves travel at different rates according to the density of the material of which they are traveling through. Whats more, S waves cannot travel through liquids so they can be effectively used to determine at which depth the composition of the Earth shifts from a solid to a liquid. Data gathered from these waves have allowed seismologists to determine the relative thickness and composition of the layers of the Earth.
