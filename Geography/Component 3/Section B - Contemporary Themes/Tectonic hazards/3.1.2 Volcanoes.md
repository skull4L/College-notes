### Essay Planning
>Volcanic hazards are predictable and any losses result from human miss-management

- Losses/impacts
    - Social (HESH)
    - Economic (CLIB)
    - Demographic (Birth rate, death rate, migration)
    - Environmental
    - Political

### Primary Hazards
- Lava flows
    - Eruption of magma. Direct damage to property, depending on composition, can move very fast and pose a risk to human life. Also causes fires which are secondary hazards. Icelandic eruption of Heimaey, predicted direction of lava flow which allowed for evacuation. They sprayed the flow with water to slow it. Well managed but only because of HIC status
- Pyroclastic flows
    - Very fast moving mix of ash, gas, dust volcanic rock and so can be difficult to predict. Causes mass death and destruction. Pompeii erruption, extreme loss of life, entire city was covered in ash with little warning.

### Secondary Hazards
- Lahars
    - Mudflows of volcanic material, second most dangerous threat to people other than pyroclastic flows
- Volcanic landslides
    - Gravity driven slides of masses of rock and loose material, can occur after heavy rainfall. Ground deformation of volcanic slopes by rising magma could trigger slope instability. Can be predicted easier. Mount St Helens
