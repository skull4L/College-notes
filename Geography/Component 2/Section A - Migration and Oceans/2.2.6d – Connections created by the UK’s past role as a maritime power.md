## Britain as a maritime power
- Historically, the UK was the world’s ‘greatest’ naval superpower. 
- In 1920, Britain ruled 20% of the world’s population and 25% of its land area. 
- The Royal Navy dominated the world’s oceans and in 1914 was twice as large as the German navy.

###### Pre-1850
- Small colonies were conquered on coastal fringes and islands (e.g. New England (USA), Jamaica, Accra (Ghana) and Bombay (now Mumbai, India). 
- Trade in sugar, tea, coffee and slaves was protected by the navy as were the interests of private trading companies such as the East India Company.

###### 1850-1945
- Coastal colonies extended inland, and British colonial administrations were established to rule the colonial populations. 
- Complex ocean trade developed including the export of UK goods to colonial markets.

###### 1960s
- The dismantling of the British Empire, but with connections between ex-British territories remaining (e.g. India and Pakistan gained independence through the 1947 Indian Independence Act). 
- British cities with a maritime heritage (London, Liverpool, Bristol) are the most culturally diverse settlements as they were hubs for trade and migration (e.g. HMS Windrush from Jamaica in 1948).

###### The Commonwealth
- Formed in London in 1949 with the London Declaration, the modern commonwealth is a voluntary organisation of 54 independent and equal countries, many of which (but not all, e.g. Rwanda who joined in 2009) have a colonial history with the UK. 
- It is home to 2.5 billion people and includes HICs, EEs and LICs. 
- 32 member states are small island nations such as Fiji. 
- Member states agree to share goals such as prosperity, development, democracy and peace and the protection of the environment expressed in the Commonwealth Charter. 
- There are 19 African nations who are members of the modern commonwealth. 
- Britain’s past as a maritime power is essential for understanding many aspects of contemporary British life.

## Essay: Cultural change in the uk has occurred mainly because of its past role as a maritime power. Discuss
###### Conclusion
- Cultural changes in the uk as a result of maritime history has had a large effect, however with the rise of globalization this has become less relevant over time.

###### Evidence
- The uk joined the EU in 2004, this caused huge influxes of European migrants, none of which had anything to do with the UKs maritime history
- Many communities that came over due to the connections are long since established. Therefore past connections cannot be the primary force behind cultural change
- The rise of the Internet since 1995 has caused the amalgamation of cultures which has had a large effect on almost every aspect of british culture such as food, fasion and music

###### However
- Huge migration from ex colonies which has altered every apect of english culture
- The uk has always been considered as hub for migration. This reputation only exists because of england's colonial past

###### Essay
The United Kingdom's maritime past has had an immense effect on our culture, but I believe that this is lessening over time due to the rise of other factors such as the Internet and increased globalization.

While colonial connections have caused a huge growth in diversity of Britain's population, this change has diminished as various diasporas have become established within the country and are less linked to the culture of their country of origin. This suggests that current cultural change is less so connected to past connections and is evolving in its own unique way. This can be best exemplified by Indian migration to the UK. British indians as a people have evolved significantly from a cultural aspect
