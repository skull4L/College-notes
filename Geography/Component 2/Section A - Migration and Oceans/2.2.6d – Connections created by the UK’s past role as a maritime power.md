## Britain as a maritime power
- Historically, the UK was the world’s ‘greatest’ naval superpower. 
- In 1920, Britain ruled 20% of the world’s population and 25% of its land area. 
- The Royal Navy dominated the world’s oceans and in 1914 was twice as large as the German navy.

###### Pre-1850
- Small colonies were conquered on coastal fringes and islands (e.g. New England (USA), Jamaica, Accra (Ghana) and Bombay (now Mumbai, India). 
- Trade in sugar, tea, coffee and slaves was protected by the navy as were the interests of private trading companies such as the East India Company.

###### 1850-1945
- Coastal colonies extended inland, and British colonial administrations were established to rule the colonial populations. 
- Complex ocean trade developed including the export of UK goods to colonial markets.

###### 1960s
- The dismantling of the British Empire, but with connections between ex-British territories remaining (e.g. India and Pakistan gained independence through the 1947 Indian Independence Act). 
- British cities with a maritime heritage (London, Liverpool, Bristol) are the most culturally diverse settlements as they were hubs for trade and migration (e.g. HMS Windrush from Jamaica in 1948).

###### The Commonwealth
- Formed in London in 1949 with the London Declaration, the modern commonwealth is a voluntary organisation of 54 independent and equal countries, many of which (but not all, e.g. Rwanda who joined in 2009) have a colonial history with the UK. 
- It is home to 2.5 billion people and includes HICs, EEs and LICs. 
- 32 member states are small island nations such as Fiji. 
- Member states agree to share goals such as prosperity, development, democracy and peace and the protection of the environment expressed in the Commonwealth Charter. 
- There are 19 African nations who are members of the modern commonwealth. 
- Britain’s past as a maritime power is essential for understanding many aspects of contemporary British life.
