- Supercontinent formation reduces marine biodiversity because there is less biodiversity
- Continents located at the poles cause global cooling due to high altitudes and high latitude encourages snow/ice due to cooling effect
- Changes in arrangements of continents and oceans controls circulation patterns in the ocean, which can change climates
- Supercontinents tend to encourage drier climates
