- Happened 250Ma as a result of volcanic eruptions
- Wiped out 95% of all life
- Evidence for this can be found in the Karoo Basin in South Africa
    - Lower layers of fossiliferous gray and green rocks indicated lush, moist alive environments
    - Higher layers of red rocks indicate a drier and warmer environment. Barely any fossils
- Evidence from Greenland suggests that extinction occurred over a more gradual period
- Siberian traps show volcanic rocks over a vast area, result of flood basalts which occur over an extreme area
- Laki, Iceland - 1783 - a modern comparison but much much much smaller
- Effects:
    - Lavaflows
    - Ash
    - Sulphur dioxide leading to acidification which destroyed ecosystems. As well as this H2SO4 caused global cooling which had a more lasting effect
- Siberian trap erruption lasted 1/2Ma and occured over 3M square miles
- This was 200,000x worst than Laki
- Increase of CO2 led to less stomata on plant leaves
- This is shown by 250Ma fossil plants
- 20x CO2 levels than today which warmed the atmosphere by 5 degrees
