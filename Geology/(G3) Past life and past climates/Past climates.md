###### Climate/temperature
- 3 warm periods
    - Cretaceous
    - Triassic
    - Devonian

- 3 cool periods
    - Pleistocene
    - Upper Carboniferous
    - Upper Ordovician

- Snowball Earth events
    - Ordovician Cryogenian
    - Neoproterzoic

###### Atmospheric composition
- Present atmosphere
    - 71% nitrogen
    - 28% oxygen
    - 420ppm carbon dioxide

- Past atmosphere
    - 92% carbon dioxide
    - 5.1% nitrogen
    - 2.3% Sulphur dioxide

- Great oxygenation event
    - Formation of kenorland 2.7Ba
    - Provided shallow areas where photosynthetic bacteria could grow
    - Led to rapid oxygenation

###### Sea level
- Times of high sea level
    - Upper Cretaceous
    - Ordovician

- Times of low sea level
    - Tertiary
    - Precambrian

## Present day climate
- Regulated by thermo-haline circulation in the oceans that redistributes heat energy around the planet
- Thermo = temp
- Haline = salt
- Melting ice sheets contribute cold water which sinks
- Process linked to atmospheric circulation and the coriolis effect
- Such as the trade winds such as the Gulf Stream from Mexico to Europe
