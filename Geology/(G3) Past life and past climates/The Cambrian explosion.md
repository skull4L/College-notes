- Marked by the development of organisms with hard parts such as:
    - Echinoderms
    - Brachiopods
    - Trilobites

## Possible Causes
- It is unknown what caused the Cambrian explosion
- There are a number of theories which speculate what exactly was the main driving force behind this rapid evolution

###### Increased Oxygen Levels
- It is theorized that oxygen availability was the main thing holding evolution back
- Production of oxygen by cyanobacteria and algae produced oxygen via photosynthesis
- This may have made it possible for more complex life to evolve
- The snowball earth phenomenon explains that oxygen levels had increased long before the beginning of the Cambrian so t is difficult to conclude that this was the cause

###### Increased Mineral Availability
- Post glacial erosion increased mineral availability in the ocean
- This could allow for the construction of shells and other hard parts
- However Cambrian shells are made from a variety of different minerals which indicates parallel evolution instead of a single 'evolutionary innovation'
- This shows that there must have been another factor which encouraged this feature to evolve multiple times

###### Evolutionary Innovation
- Bilateral symmetry could be the cause of the Cambrian explosion
- This feature encouraged the evolution of many other features such as nervous systems, digestive tracts and eyes

###### Ecological Feedback
- Interaction between predator and prey species
- The appearance of predators may have been a cause of the Cambrian explosion as this essentially created an evolutionary 'arms race'
- Predators evolved new systems such as vision to aid with finding food while pray evolved features such as hard shells to avoid being eaten
- It is believed that in particular, the evolution of vision could be alone the cause of the Cambrian explosion as it put selection pressure on prey organisms.

###### Disappearance of Ediacaran Fauna
- The Cambrian explosion could have resulted from a recovery from a mass extinction event
- Signs of this extinction event could have completely disappeared by now, so there's no way of ruling it out

## Examples of Precambrian Rock Formations
- Chengjiang formation (515ma, lower Cambrian - China)
- Burgess shale formation (508ma, middle Cambrian - Canada )

## Preservation of Cambrian Biota
- Cambrian deposits contain remains of soft-bodied organisms which are notoriously hard to preserve
- Deposits where these occur provide us with a window into early metazoan evolution (multicellular)
- In normal conditions such soft bodied organisms would have completely decomposed, making these deposits very rare
- Such deposits also include preservation of legs, gills, gut traces and muscle blocks in many species
- Many organisms found here appear to be completely unrelated to other known species, these are described as having 'unknown affinity'
- Soft parts are often preserved as aluminosilicate films, often associated with iron mineralization
- Iron pyrite preservation has allowed detailed fossilization of many organic remains, which may have resulted from the inhibition of bacterial activity caused by anaerobic conditions.
- Turbidity currents may have been involved in the preservation of Cambrian biota, this would have resulted in rapid entombment which 'seal' organisms, increasing the chances of exceptional preservation.

## Burgess Shale Formation
- This has become the best known Konservat-Lagerst√§tte in the fossil record and is exposed in the Canadian Rockies.
- This preserves hundreds of taxa as part of the Cambrian Explosion.
- This was important, as prior to the discovery of exceptionally preserved organisms, only hard parts remained in sediments.
- It helps us to understand that complex communities were in place early in evolutionary history

###### Geological Setting
- It was initially thought that these deposits were the result of a catastrophic underwater landslide or turbidity current.
- It was postulated that the communities existed on a continental platform, which was then transported during a catastrophic event into an anoxic basin, over a distance of around 2 km.
- The assumption was that exceptional preservation was not possible if there was oxygen present on the sea floor, as decay would occur.
- However, more recent studies have shown that the basin floor was suitable for life due to the following observations:
    - Most organisms were buried in their habitat, or have suffered only minor disturbance.
    - There were benthonic organisms preserved in life position, such as many species of sponge and some brachiopods.
    - Most decay processes took place prior to burial and resulted in disarticulation when burial occurred
    - There was evidence that variable amounts of disarticulations had occured some organisms, indicating transport, but only over very short distances
    - Early mineralisation of body tissues occurred soon after burial (during early diagenesis)
- The most likely explanation is these organisms actually lived in a relatively deep Cambrian basin, in tropical waters. There was an escarpment of algal reefs several hundred metres high (Cathedral Escarpment) and a carbonate platform beyond, which probably extended 400km towards the shoreline.
- The sea floor was fed by periodic influxes of sediment, as a result of small turbidity currents or 'slurries' which then covered the organisms currently on the basin floor. At the point of any 'slurry', there were live and dead organisms on the sea floor. Some had already partly decayed, whilst others were buried alive (entombed).

###### Biota
- Around 40% of the biota are arthropods: these possessed hard exoskeletons and include trilobites. The exoskeletons are often calcified during preservation. Limbs, antennae, gills, gut traces and other soft tissues are often preserved. There are many examples of the trilobite Olenoides which have preserved legs and gills.
- Trace fossils are present in varying amounts, indicating that conditions on the sea floor were oxic and conducive to life at the time, whilst conditions within the sediments may have been anaerobic for at least some of the time. However, only a few infaunal organisms had evolved at this stage in the Cambrian, so scope for many infaunal organisms was limited.
