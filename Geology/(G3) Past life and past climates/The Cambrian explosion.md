## Preservation of Cambrian biota
- Cambrian deposits contain remains of soft-bodied organisms which are notoriously hard to preserve
- Deposits where these occur provide us with a window into early metazoan evolution (multicellular)
- In normal conditions such soft bodied organisms would have completely decomposed, making these deposits very rare
- Such deposits also include preservation of legs, gills, gut traces and muscle blocks in many species
- Many organisms found here appear to be completely unrelated to other known species, these are described as having 'unknown affinity'

- Soft parts are often preserved as aluminosilicate films often associated with iron mineralization
