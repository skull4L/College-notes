## Evidence
- Flinders Ranges, Australia
- Dropstones
    - Similar to glacial erratics, but deposited by boulders dropping out as an oceanic ice sheet melts
    - Dropstones deposited in the tropics and at the equator suggests a global glaciation

## Cause
- Very low levels of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere + feedback effect of ice formation
- Albedo
    - The proportion of incident light that is reflected.  
    - Ice has a very high albedo and reflects about 90% of the incoming energy from the Sun back into space
- Impact of weathering
    - carbon is moved from the atmosphere store to the ocean store and is locked away into the long carbon cycle in rocks
    - Rate of chemical weathering is more rapid in the tropics.  
    - Hot and humid conditions act as a catalyst to chemical reactions.  
    - The continental landmasses were located in low-latitudes at this time in Earth history
    - Therefore there were extensive landmasses in a location where weathering is more extensive, so carbon was removed at a greater rate than usual
