- A mass extinction is a period of large scale decline in biodiversity over a short time frame.
- The best example of this is the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction which wiped out the dinosaurs
- These span in duration from a few thousand years to a couple million years
- It is believed that we are currently in the middle of a mass extinction event, caused by human impact on the environment since the industrial revolution
- Throughout time there have been 5 large scale mass extinctions these are:
    - Ordovician-Silurian
    - Late Devonian
    - Permo-Triassic
    - Triassic-Jurassic
    - Cretaceous-Tertiary

## Causes of mass extinctions
###### Asteroid impacts
- These are indicated by a number of factors:
    - Thin layers of rare earth elements such as iridium in rock sequences
    - Thin layers of shocked quartz grains in rock sequences
    - The presence of tektites
    - Indication of large scale tsunamis
    - Large meteoric craters
- The best example of this taking place is the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction
- 60-70% of all species became extinct here

###### Large scale volcanicity
- Indicated by large scale regions of igneous rocks
- An example of this is the Permo-Triassic extinction
- They cause mass extinctions by:
    - Killing everything in the vicinity due to toxic gasses, pyroclastic flows or lava flows
    - Global dimming caused by ash particles in the atmosphere, leading to global glaciations and sea level drops. This would remove habitats for marine organisms that rely on the shallow continental shelf
    - Emission of greenhouse gasses causes rapid increase in global temperatures and SO2 causes acid rain

###### Changes in sea levels
- Indicated by a combination of geochemical data, fossil data and lithological data
- An example of this is the Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction
- Loss of continental shelf area limits the habitat of many marine organisms leading to rapid decline in biodiversity

###### Rapid climate change
- Indicated by the ratio of oxygen isotopes found in shells
- An example of this is the Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction
- Rapid climate change causes environments to change quicker than organisms can adapt to leading to mass extinction
