- Dinosaurs evolved from Archosaurs, after the Permo-Triassic mass extinction and went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous
- Hip bones can be used to classify dinosaurs, made up of 3 bones, (llium, ischium and pubis) known as the pelvis with a hole in the center for the head of the femur
- They laid hard eggs which indicates that they were terrestrial, similar to those of modern birds
## Characteristics of Saurischian dinosaurs
- Primitive hip bones, more similar to other reptiles
- S shaped flexible neck allowing for rapid and precise movement
- 3 digit hands, asymmetrical with first digit being similar to a thumb

## Characteristics of Ornithischian dinosaurs
- Bird like hip bones, backwards pointing pubis
- Small or absent front teeth, replaced by a beak
- Many had bony plates, defence mechanism against predation but also possibly used in heat exchange.

###### Tyrannosaurus rex (Theropoda)
- Large, curved teeth indicate that it was carnivorous
- Large, powerful legs indicate that it could run fast
- Front facing eyes may indicate that it was predatory
- Large head cavity may indicate intelligence
- Large jaws indicate powerful bite useful for hunting

###### Pachycephalosurus (Ornithischila)
- Small teeth indicate herbivorous diet
- Side facing eyes indicate that it was a prey species
- Bony skull was most likely for defence but may have also been for mating

###### Parasaurolophus (Ornithischila)
- Elongated head may have been for heat exchange, or for mating call
- Side facing eyes indicate that it was a prey species
- Beak indicates herbivorous diet
- Longer neck indicates that it was designed to eat from bushes and short trees

###### Stegosaurus (Ornithischila)
- Armoured plates indicate that it was a prey species but may have also been used for heat exchange
- Small head indicates herbivorous diet
- Spines on tail were most likely for defence

###### Ankylosaurus (Ornithischila)
- Armoured plates indicate that it was a prey species but may have also been used for heat exchange
- Small head indicates herbivorous diet
- Club on tail were most likely for defence
- Large robust skeleton indicates that it was slow moving

###### Velociraptor (Theropoda)
- Large, curved teeth indicate that it was carnivorous
- Large, powerful legs indicate that it could run fast
- Front facing eyes may indicate that it was predatory
- Large head cavity may indicate intelligence
- Large jaws indicate powerful bite useful for hunting
- Large claws indicate it was predatory

###### Diplodocus (Sauropoda)
- Long slender skull indicates that it was adapted to grazing
- Long neck indicates ability to graze on tree vegetation
- Peg like teeth at the front of jaw indicates that it swallowed vegetation whole, meaning that bacterial action and gastroliths were most likely necessary for digestion
- Reinforced spinal cord indicated that it was extremely large and needed extra support and mobility to head and tail
- Long whip like tail possibly used for self defence

###### Triceratops (Ornithischila)
- Large spiked head was most likely for defence, but also possibly heat exchange and mating
- Large, robust skeleton indicated that it was slow moving
- Beak indicates that it was herbivorous
- Sidewards facing eyes indicate that it was a prey species
