## Magmatic segregation
- Sinking of early forming ore minerals to the floor of a basic magma chamber
- Also formed by separation and sinking of sulphide and oxide liquids from basic magmas.
- The liquids crystallize between silicate minerals or they are injected into cracks in the rock around the intrusion
- Examples:
    - Copper
    - Tin
    - Tungsten
    - Lead
    - Zinc

## Hydrothermal activity
- Deposited from hot watery solutions
- The water can come from magma, sedimentary rocks, from the surface or from rocks being metamorphosed
- Ore minerals found in veins or filling fine cracks in the rock
