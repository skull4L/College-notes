- Hydrocarbons are substances that form from the partial decay and subsequent fossilization of microscopic marine organisms such as plankton and microalgae.
- They form in low energy, anoxic marine environments where aerobic decomposition or scavenging cannot take place.
- For hydrocarbon deposits to occur 6 factors must be met:
	- Source rock: Organic rich, fine-grained rock which eventually becomes the hydrocarbons themselves
	- Reservoir rock: A permeable rock that can be used to store these hydrocarbons 
	- Cap rock: An impermeable rock layer that prevents upwards migration of oil and gas, trapping it.
	- Ages of these rocks relative to eachother
	- Stratigraphic and structural traps
	- Correct depth
- Maturation is the process by which petroleum and its products form. It involves organic matter being broken down into kerogen which is a mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur containing substances. This then breaks down into petroleum.
- The oil window is the temperature range where oil is most likely to be found between 50-100C between 2000 and 5500m below sea level
- Gas has a higher window of temperatures at 100-200C and a depth between 3000 and 5000m
- The economic basement is rock layer below which economic hydrocarbon reservoirs are not expected to be found
- Migration of hydrocarbons occurs when the source rock is compacted leading to water, carrying droplets of oil to rise up. They continue rising until they encounter a rock cap which is an impermeable layer of rock
- Traps are concentrations of hydrocarbons which are economic to extract, for this to occur there needs to be impermiable rock preventing migration. There are multiple types:
	- Anticline traps: Most common, larger folds can contain more hydrocarbons
	- Fault traps: Brings impermeable rock next to a reservoir rock, preventing lateral migration
	- Salt dome traps: Evaporites form large salt domes, these are impermeable. Hydrocarbons accumulate where this dome meets reservoir rock
