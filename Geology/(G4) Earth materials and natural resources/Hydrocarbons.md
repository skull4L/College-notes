- Hydrocarbons are substances that form from the partial decay and subsequent fossilization of microscopic marine organisms such as plankton and microalgae.
- They form in low energy, anoxic marine environments where aerobic decomposition or scavenging cannot take place.
- For hydrocarbon deposits to occur 6 factors must be met:
	- Source rock: Organic rich, fine-grained rock which eventually becomes the hydrocarbons themselves
	- Reservoir rock: A permeable rock that can be used to store these hydrocarbons 
	- Cap rock: An impermeable rock
