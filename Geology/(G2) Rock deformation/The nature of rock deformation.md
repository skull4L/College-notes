## The Nature of Rock Deformation
- The nature of rock deformation is determined by the competence of parent rock and conditions during deformation (temperature,confining pressure, strain rate)
- Competent rocks will deform in a brittle manner, these include:
    - Sandstone
    - Limestone
    - Most igneous rocks
- Incompetent rocks will deform in a plastic manner, these include
    - Mudstone
    - Shale

### Factors Affecting Stress and Strain
- The higher the temperature, the more plastic the rocks will be. At high temperatures rocks will fold, whereas cold rocks will fault
- Confining pressure increases rock strength, making deformation much more difficult. The mass of overlying rocks causes this pressure
- Time is important, If stress is applied over a short period brittle deformation will occur while if stress is applied over a longer period result in plastic deformation
- It is important to note that these 3 factors operate together
- These 3 factors mean that rocks higher in the crust are more likely to break in a brittle manner, as rocks are often colder and at lower pressures. Rocks lower in crust deform in a more plastic manner as they are hotter and under higher pressure
- Rock competence is independent to crust depth
