- Minerals are natural chemical structures with set compositions and crystalline structures
- Silicates are the most important rock forming minerals and contain silicon and oxygen
    - They form most rocks on earth
- Most minerals are compounds but some contain one element only, for example:
    - Native copper
    - Native sulphur

## Elements
- More than 98% of the crust consists of 8 elements
- Quartz which is a framework silicate of silicon and oxygen (SiO2) is one of the most common minerals found in the crust
- Another common mineral, calcite which is found in limestone is composed of calcium and oxygen (CaCO3)
- Some elements are compounds of sulphur instead of oxygen. For example:
    - Galena (PbS)
    - Pyrite (FeS2)

### Abundance of elements in the Earth's crust
| Element    | Mass per cent | Chemical symbol |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Oxygen     | 46.6%         | O               |
| Silicon    | 27.7%         | Si              |
| Aluminium  | 8.1%          | Al              |
| Iron       | 5.0%          | Fe              |
| Calcium    | 3.6%          | Ca              |
| Sodium     | 2.8%          | Na              |
| Potassium  | 2.6%          | K               |
| Magnesium  | 2.1%          | Mg              | 
| All others | <1.5%         |                 |

## Crystals
- Crystals are solid but often form from liquids. For example Quartz forms from liquid magma
- Ions behave differently depending on their state. They have greater velocity in a liquid as they have more thermal energy. They are also disorganised and do not form a pattern
- Slow cooling gives time for ions to organise themselves. Therefore the slower a magma cools, the larger the crystals are.
- Slow cooling does not give time for ions to organise, they freeze in place and form what is known as a natural glass. Glass is not a mineral
