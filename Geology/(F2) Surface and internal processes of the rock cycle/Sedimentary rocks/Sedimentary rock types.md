- Sedimentary rocks are rocks comprised of fragments (referred to as clasts) of other rocks.
- There are different types of sedimentary rocks depending on a number of factors such as energy of deposition environments, erosional processes and even living organisms

## Conglomerates
- Clasts range in size from 1 mm to 3 cm
- Extremely poorly sorted
- Often mineralogically mature composition such as flint
- Clasts are all well-rounded 
- Held together by a fine-grained cement
- Often occurs in high energy environments with high levels of erosion such as beaches

## Breccia
- Clasts range in size from 1 mm to 3 cm
- Extremely poorly sorted
- Mineralogically immature composition such as limestone, basalt, slate and quartz
- Clasts are extremely angular
- Matrix is made up of smaller angular pieces, known as micro breccia (<0.25mm) and red cement from iron oxide
- Produced by flash flooding in a desert environment
