        - Chlorite Low grade
        - Biotite
        - Garnet Medium grade
        - Kyanite
        - Sillimanite High grade
- This is the order of metamorphism
- Framework silicates such as quartz and plagioclase feldspar are stable throughout metamorphism. This makes them useless as index minerals.

### Metamorphic Zones
- The area between 2 isograds. Named after the lower grade one. All locations within the zone are the same metamorphic grade.
- Isograd: line on a map joining points of equal metamophic grade
- Metamorphic facies are a set of metamorphic minerals that were formed under similar pressures and temperatures. This allows rocks containing particular assemblages of minerals to be linked to certain tectonic settings and times.
