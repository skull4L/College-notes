- Sediment gets finer grained further away from land. Different zones are characterised by different sedimentary facies.

- Delta top
    - Dominated by distributary channels with areas of swamps, bays and flood plains
        - Swamps contain anaerobic conditions, which allows peat and later coal formation.
            - Terrestrial fossil deposits
    - Frequent changes to sedimentation patterns as channels change course
    - Deposits known as topsets, which are coarse grained sands and gravels.
        - Forms channel sandstone, which is sometimes cross bedded

- Delta front
    - Especially graded bedding.
    - Vertical succession
