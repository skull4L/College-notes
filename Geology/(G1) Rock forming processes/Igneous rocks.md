### SP8 Describing Igneous Rocks
- rock is holocrystaline
- medium grained
- porphyritic
- medium grain size
- Large Phenocrysts with medium groundmass

- The hottest forming minerals crystallise and sync to the bottom, this happens to all subsequent minerals down the Bowen's Reaction series this is known as fractional crystallisation.

### Layered Intrusions
- Layered intrusions are essentially fractional crystallisation on a much larger scale. Different layers of crystals separate out forming distinct rock types stacked on top of each other.
- The igneous bodies also cool faster near the edges, which has an effect on fractional crystallisation.

- As shown by the diagram depicting the Pallisades Sill, fractional crystallisation has pulled olivine down into a distinct layer. Near the edges of the sill, due to the faster cooling this has not occurred as much allowing Dolerite to form. The slowest cooling rock at the center of the intrusion has formed Gabbro which is slightly less mafic.
