- Meta means change, morph means form
- A change in form of pre-existing rocks of all types. Sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic itself.
- By the action of heat alone (contact)
- By the action of pressure alone (dynamic)
- By the action of both (regional)

### Metamorphic grade
- The extent of which the pre existing rocks have been changed in form
- Low grade - slight alteration
- Medium grade - significant alteration
- High grade - extensive/total alteration

### Metamorphic changes
- Are assumed to be isochemical
- The bulk chemical composition of the parent rock and the metamorphic product are identical.
-  Both contain the same % Si, Al, O, Na etc.
- The only loss from the system is water as hydrous clay minerals are dehydrated by a rise in temperature

### Contact Metamorphism
- Changes due to the action of heat alone Associated with large scale igneous bodies
- Batholiths and plutons of granite/gabbro
- Example around the edges of the granites in S.W. England (St.Austell, Bodmin etc) 
- Metamorphic aureole refers to the volume of rock affected by heat from the intrusion

### Controlling Factors - Contact
- Size and shape of the igneous body
- Composition - Acid magma 800 degrees centigrade, basic magma 1200 degrees
- Thermal conductivity of the country rocks 
- Volatile content of the magma
- Distance from edge of igneous body of any location in the country rocks

### The Metamorphic Aureole
- The total volume of older 'country rocks' affected by heat from the intrusion
- Grade of metamorphism decreases from the intrusion towards the edge of the aureole
- By convention aureoles need to be over 50 metres wide to be marked on 1:50,000 scale BGS maps

### Contact Metamorphism Of Argillaceous Rocks
- Argillaceous rocks which have undergone metamorphism are referred to as Pelites - Low Grade-Spotted Rock
- Medium Grade-Chiastolite Rock
- High Grade-Hornfels
- Argillaceous rocks undergo most change as they are composed of chemically complex clay minerals such as kaolinite, illite, smectite, bentonite and montmorillianite.
