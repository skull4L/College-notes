>Describe and explain how the Earthâ€™s biota affects the chemical composition of the atmosphere.

The biotic aspects of Earth have an enormous effect on atmospheric composition. This is mainly related to the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the result of respiration in animals so the abundance of them increases co2's atmospheric percentage. Plants are also an important factor as they produce oxygen from carbon dioxide. Ratios of plants to animals is an important biological factor in the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide. Throughout geological time this has changed significantly. 

The Cambrian explosion is the first evidence of this change being driven by biotic processes. Single celled organisms in the ocean exploded in population which caused oxygen levels in the atmosphere to sharply rise. This was an extreme change as carbon dioxide was in high concentration before this period and oxygen made up only a fraction of the atmosphere's composition. This event was what allowed more complex life to evolve. During this period oxygen breathing animals were not as common so this oxygen composition grew at a fast rate.

Another example of this is the Carboniferous period, often referred to as the age of oxygen. This period of elevated oxygen content and low carbon dioxide was due to a high abundance of plant growth. Tree ferns dominated the primordial swamps that were common at the time. What's more, bacteria capable of breaking down dead plant matter had not evolved by this period so the carbon absorbed from photosynthesis would be removed from the fast carbon cycle and would cause carbon dioxide levels to gradually decline over time. These biotic driven factors clearly had a huge effect on the global chemical composition of the atmosphere.
