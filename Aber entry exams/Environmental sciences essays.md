>Describe and explain how the Earthâ€™s biota affects the chemical composition of the atmosphere.

The biotic aspects of Earth have an enormous effect on atmospheric composition. This is mainly related to the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the result of respiration in animals so as the abundance of them increases its atmospheric percentage. Plants are also an important factor as they produce oxygen from carbon dioxide. Ratios of plants to animals is the main biological factor in the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide. Throughout geological time this has changed significantly.
