Water quality in rivers is an important aspect of the environment as it affects the health and wellbeing of humans, wildlife and the overall ecosystem. Pollution is a major factor that negatively impacts water quality, leading to a range of negative effects including contamination of drinking water, harm to aquatic life, and degradation of the environment.

There are many sources of pollution that can affect water quality in rivers. Some of the main sources of water pollution include:

1.  Agricultural activities - This includes runoff from farms and agricultural lands which can contain fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals that can contaminate the water and harm aquatic life.
    
2.  Industrial activities - Industries that discharge waste into rivers can cause a significant impact on water quality. This waste can contain toxic chemicals, heavy metals and other pollutants that can harm the environment and human health.
    
3.  Sewage and wastewater - Uncontrolled discharge of raw sewage and wastewater can lead to the introduction of pathogens and other pollutants into rivers.
    
4.  Urbanization - The rapid urbanization and growth of cities can lead to increased runoff of pollutants, including heavy metals and oil, from roads and buildings.
    
5.  Mining activities - The extraction of minerals from the earth can release toxic chemicals into rivers, which can harm the environment and aquatic life.
    

The impact of pollution on water quality in rivers can be significant and long-lasting. For example, exposure to pollutants can harm aquatic life, including fish and other aquatic organisms, which can have a knock-on effect on the ecosystem as a whole. Additionally, pollutants in rivers can cause harm to humans who consume contaminated water or who use the water for recreational purposes.

However, there are options available to treat water quality and reduce the impact of pollution on rivers. Some of the main options include:

1.  Wastewater treatment - This involves treating sewage and other wastewater to remove pollutants before it is released into rivers. This can help to reduce the impact of pollutants on the environment and aquatic life.
    
2.  Point source control - This involves controlling the discharge of pollutants from specific sources, such as industries and sewage treatment plants. This can help to reduce the overall level of pollutants in rivers.
    
3.  Non-point source control - This involves controlling the runoff of pollutants from non-specific sources, such as agricultural land and urban areas. This can help to reduce the impact of pollutants on rivers and the environment.
    
4.  Water treatment plants - These are facilities that are designed to remove pollutants from water, including heavy metals and other toxic chemicals. The treated water can then be used for drinking, irrigation, and other purposes.
    
5.  Land management practices - This involves managing the use of land to reduce the impact of pollutants on rivers. For example, planting trees and vegetation can help to reduce runoff from urban areas, while proper management of agricultural land can reduce the runoff of fertilizers and pesticides.
    

In conclusion, water quality in rivers is a critical aspect of the environment that is negatively impacted by pollution. The sources of pollution include agricultural activities, industrial activities, sewage and wastewater, urbanization, and mining activities. The impact of pollution on water quality can be significant and long-lasting, causing harm to aquatic life and humans who use the water. However, there are options available to reduce the impact of pollution on rivers, including wastewater treatment, point source control, non-point source control, water treatment plants, and land management practices. Implementing these options can help to improve water quality and protect the environment for future generations.
