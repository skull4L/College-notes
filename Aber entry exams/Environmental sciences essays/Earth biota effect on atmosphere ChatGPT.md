The Earth’s biota refers to the collection of all living organisms that make up the Earth's ecosystem, including all the plants, animals, bacteria, and other microorganisms that inhabit the planet. The Earth’s biota has a significant impact on the chemical composition of the atmosphere, as living organisms produce and consume a variety of gases that alter the atmosphere's composition.

One of the most well-known examples of the Earth's biota affecting the atmosphere is photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process in which plants and other photosynthetic organisms use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose produced is used as food for the organism, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis has been instrumental in the evolution of the Earth's atmosphere, as the process has gradually removed CO2 from the atmosphere and converted it into plant biomass over time. This process has helped regulate the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and prevent it from reaching levels that would be toxic to many forms of life.

Another way in which the Earth's biota affects the atmosphere is through respiration. Respiration is the process in which living organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms, convert glucose and oxygen into carbon dioxide and water. This process releases CO2 into the atmosphere, adding to the overall levels of atmospheric CO2. The amount of CO2 produced by respiration is proportional to the amount of organic matter in the biosphere, and it is the primary source of CO2 in the atmosphere. Respiration is essential for the survival of living organisms, but it also contributes to global warming by increasing the levels of atmospheric CO2.

The Earth's biota also affects the atmosphere through the release of methane (CH4). Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that has a much greater warming effect than CO2. Methane is produced by a variety of living organisms, including microbes in the gut of ruminant animals such as cows and sheep, and it is also produced through the decomposition of organic matter in anaerobic environments such as rice paddies, wetlands, and landfills. Methane is a critical component of the Earth's climate system, and changes in the levels of atmospheric methane can have a significant impact on the global climate.

Another way in which the Earth's biota affects the atmosphere is through the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are organic compounds that are emitted into the atmosphere by a variety of living organisms, including plants and microorganisms. These compounds can contribute to the formation of air pollution, as well as the production of ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant. VOCs can also contribute to climate change by affecting the atmospheric radiation balance, as well as by forming clouds and altering the atmospheric chemistry.

Finally, the Earth's biota can affect the atmosphere by releasing nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxides are produced by a variety of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and some plants. These compounds play a critical role in the Earth's atmospheric chemistry, as they help to regulate the levels of ozone in the stratosphere. NOx also contributes to the formation of smog, which is a form of air pollution that is harmful to human health.

In conclusion, the Earth's biota has a significant impact on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Through processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, the release of methane, volatile organic compounds, and nitrogen oxides, the Earth's biota alters the levels of key atmospheric gases, such as CO2, methane, ozone, and smog, and affects the Earth's climate and air quality.
